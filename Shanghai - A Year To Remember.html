        <section id="_Toc51365544">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Foreword, Disclaimer, Whatever</h2>
            <p class="disclaimer">
                Disclaimer: This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents either are the products
                of the author’s imagination or are used in the fictitious context. Any resemblance to actual persons,
                living or dead, businesses, companies, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Okay, that’s out of the way, lets to the real point.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As one can expect, a fiction, especially like this one you are attempting to read, is
                usually a work inspired by our accumulated experiences with a bit of imagination thrown in, and it would
                be unfair to claim that this work is entirely imaginary. I have made a sincere effort to ensure the
                identity of people from real life, whom I may or may not have slipped into this story, is sufficiently
                masked. What I am trying to say is, if you think I am writing about you, please pause for a minute to
                ask yourself, how unique your life is. We all are in a rat race and the way we behave is influenced to
                some extent by the people we are forced to interact with, day in day out. As motivational speaker Jim
                Rohn aptly said, “We are the average of the five people we spend the most time with.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The story narration is in the first person due to the ease of writing this story. I
                lead a normal, boring and uneventful life, more or less, happy with whatever I have in my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Similarly, I am not the most creative person when it comes to names (amongst many other
                things), and so, if you see your name, trust me it is not you. Sometimes, I am so happy that I am not
                yet a parent as I would give my daughter or son, one of the most generic names in the world. I am that
                lazy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The story is set in Shanghai, a city I have called home for close to ten years now but
                can easily take place in any large city where millions of people live close to each other but couldn’t
                be more alone. It is only in such places you will see a long sequence of unbelievable coincidences
                happening to a normal guy. Thus, the city is irrelevant, only the characters in this story are relevant,
                but that is for you to decide.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Following the same spirit, I have tried to get rid of ethnic biases in this story, as
                much as possible. The characters can be from any nation, or any ethnicity, but me being an Indian at
                heart and in spirit, and me having lived in China for so long, might have influenced the tone of the
                story.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I struggled with the idea of a pen name for a long time as my motivation to write this
                story was very different. I was trying to write for someone else, and for money, whereas I should have
                been writing for myself and the joy of it. And, yes, I feared failure and needed a name to hide behind
                in case this book tanked. For now, I am willing to see how far this name goes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The book APE by Guy Kawasaki and Shawn Welch inspired me to write a self-published
                book. I have been trying to publish something since forever; I didn’t lack ideas, I lacked the
                motivation and I got lazy as time passed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">English is not my first language, so all the deficiencies you will see in language,
                especially around grammar usage, is entirely mine. Giving the limitation in my vocabulary, you will see
                that I have repeated many words. If you wonder why all my characters speak bad Indian-English, the
                aforementioned reasons hold.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I would have loved to write this in Mandarin Chinese as well, but I am not there yet.
                My Chinese teachers will die of a heart attack and then come back as a zombie to kill me if I even
                attempted to write this book in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Dear family members, thank you for wanting to read whatever I wrote, but don’t read
                after this point. I love you all very much, and I don’t want you all to hate me. This book is nothing
                like my blog.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My apologies in advance to all the Indians, the Chinese, and the Italians. I am not
                really that culturally inclined. Also, my apologies to the people in the medical profession, I didn’t
                bother doing any sort of research into how the human body works.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I have not plagiarised anyone’s work, and that possibly shows in the overall (lack of)
                quality in the book.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">August 28<sup>th</sup> 2020</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I have also made some minor update to the book, to correct my terrible grammar and give
                it a tiny bit more fullness. I have added some photos, which may be safely ignored, and some art work
                which I hope people won’t ignore.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were a few requests from my friends to add a Final Chapter, as the ending is
                open. I did start writing one, but that didn’t feel true to me, but I have made the effort to make a
                Final Chapter. And you may find this as a separate story in the Appendix.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The main story will remain the same, as it should in my opinion. So, apologies to my
                dear friends who were expecting the story to continue in a major way. I love you all, but let this story
                remain the same. I wrote this for the love of writing and I love this book the way it is now. I might be
                creating an offshoot story, but I am still thinking about how to tie these stories together.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I no longer live in China these days. Me and Gina (the same Gina in my dedication) is
                my wife now (In case you are interested in knowing, we got married twice, once in China and once in
                India), we decided we should see a bit more of the world before we kick the bucket.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Japan, a place I visited and worked briefly in 2006, is a place I always wanted to
                return to, and return I did. We now live in a small city in Japan and we both love it here. We are
                surrounded by nature, stray cats, a lot of lovely Japanese foods and clean air. While we don’t have Didi
                or Meituan or Shared Bikes here, we do have JapanTaxi, Family Mart and Lawson .</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In short, we are falling in love with Japan, despite the language barriers and the
                obsession with processes and procedures, especially for someone who lived in China as long as I did,
                where processes were only on the paper.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One other thing that has changed after leaving China is my view on one-party politics,
                but this book is not the right place to express such views, and I am not an expert in politics to write
                anything about such a topic.</p>

                the original form. I am not going to continue this story beyond what was published in the first edition.

            <p class="paragraph">And I lost all the versions of manuscript during my cloud migration from one big

                provider (whose search and email service a lot of us use) on a computer named after a fruit. Thankfully
                the platform where I tried to sell this book and recover the cost of my first macbook air, gave back the
                updated manuscript. Thankful to the universe for small mercies and for me to be nerd enough to make some
                edits using an IDE (on Linux).</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365549">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 1. A Chance Encounter</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">It was just a few minutes after half-past-six in the morning and I, Anandapadmanabhan
                Nair, was on my way to the Shanghai metro line 2 stop of <em>Loushanguan</em> Road. I am guessing here,
                but I think, my parents couldn’t find a longer name that went well with the surname “Nair” – I went by
                Anand. It was February, a week before Chinese New Year holidays, and the weather was cold and air crisp.
                It was a Saturday morning.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was exhausted and elevated at the same time. I had this silly grin plastered on my
                face as I stumbled towards the metro station. I have been hanging out with some of my best friends in
                Shanghai since the previous night. The holiday season was just around the corner and it was time to
                catch up with my friends in Shanghai, or whoever stayed back. As is the case with the holiday season in
                China, there was a lot of drinking and smoking, followed by a lot of singing, more drinking and more
                smoking at the KTV – a place where talentless people like me go to sing. I wanted to hang out some more
                time with my friends, but common sense prevailed, as there was no way I could stay awake and no way I
                could drink anymore.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">At around 3 AM, I dragged Allen Huang, my closest friend in Shanghai, into a taxi
                outside the KTV and took him back to his house. Thankfully his wife, Jean Li who was also my close
                friend, was not at home; she had gone back to Hangzhou with her parents for Chinese New Year
                celebrations. Allen had negotiated a dicey truce with his folks who are hard-core Shanghainese (<em>like
                    five generations in Shanghai, ignore Pudong’s existence kind of Shanghainese – Pudong is newer, and
                    in some cases fancier part of Shanghai</em>), and his wife and in-laws, who were all new
                Shanghainese, but in their hearts hard-core Hangzhouers (<em>Like sing praises for the West Lake and all
                    of its history kind of Hangzhouers</em>). Based on the truce, he will spend the Chinese New Year’s
                Eve with his parents and Chinese New Year with his wife and in-laws.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t envy Allen one bit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tried getting a ride using one of those ride-hailing platforms, but at that time of
                the night, I was having no luck finding any ride. I should have asked the taxi that dropped us to wait
                for me. Traditional taxi guys were not up during that time or didn’t want to deal with a foreigner at
                that time and, despite adding RMB 10 tip in a country where you don’t generally tip (Perhaps that was
                the problem – that I added too small a tip). In short, I couldn’t hail a ride or find a taxi. The
                Metroman app on my phone told me that if I waited till 5:46 AM, I can get the first train passing
                through the Line 2 metro station there. That was just a couple of hours away. As Allen was fast asleep,
                I decided to make myself at home. I went to his kitchen made a cup of instant coffee, then raided
                Allen’s bar for some Bailey’s Irish cream and added a generous splash into my coffee.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I quietly sat down on Allen’s plush couch in his living room and started enjoying my
                coffee. I opened my kindle app and selected a book to re-read… Day of the Jackal looked good. I have a
                simple principle – when drunk, don’t strain the brain too much. Rereading a well-read book is the least
                stressful activity in the world for me. I started reading the book and eventually finished the coffee.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could hear Allen mumbling in Shanghainese, which is the local Shanghai dialect, in
                his sleep. I made one more coffee with Irish Cream to help pass the second half of two hours, the only
                problem being that I finished the second one in under five minutes. The second coffee was a little
                stiffer than the first one and, soon started nodding off.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I am not sure when I dozed off, but I snapped awake at around quarter past six. Allen
                would be okay for me to stay over until I sobered up, but I decided I better head back home… I
                sleep-talk in English and don’t want Allen to hear some of my rants. I got out of the couch, which was
                really hard when you are drunk and the couch is super plush. I made it out of the couch and tip-toed to
                the toilet to relieve myself. I then splashed some cold water on my face to wake me up completely.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I left the coffee mug in the sink; I knew Allen has an <em>A’yi</em> (Literally means
                Aunt, but in this context means a ‘maid’) who comes in every day to clean up. I quietly slipped out of
                the apartment and sent Allen a tongue in cheek message thanking him for his “hospitality” as I rode the
                lift down to the first floor.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was fairly familiar with the area but given my general lack of sense of direction and
                my current state, I decided to take help of <em>GaoDe</em> maps. I open the app, typed out the metro
                station name in Chinese, and after a bit of confusion around which direction is which, started stumbling
                towards the metro station. I could feel the onset of a mild hangover, and all the morning noises were
                starting to irritate me. I took out my earphone from my pocket, untangled the wires, plugged it to my
                iPhone and started playing some songs I recently discovered on QQ Music. I sang along for a while but
                ended up scaring some old lady and her dog on their morning walk. These people can never appreciate the
                primal magic in my voice. In any case, I stopped singing as my throat was sore. I popped a piece of
                chewing gum into my mouth and light a cigarette. I inhaled deep and felt the sweet suffocating hold of
                nicotine-tar cloud grip my lungs and felt the mist in my head clear away slowly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The walk to the metro stop took me twenty minutes. The walk and the crisp Shanghai air
                helped clear my head a bit more and kept me awake. I crushed out the cigarette, entered the metro
                station and walked down to the metro entrance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Usually, in Shanghai, if you have a large enough bag like the laptop backpack one would
                carry to the office, you are required to pass it through the X-ray scanner before you enter the metro
                station. Since it was really early, for a weekend, and since the guards were barely awake, they didn’t
                insist on checking everyone and were ignoring pretty much anyone entering the station, including me.
                Maybe the number of people travelling at that point is so less that they figured that not much damage
                can be done, in case someone wanted to carry any “dangerous article”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I approached the entrance gate, I noticed a girl with a stunning figure struggling
                with a large bag at the entrance. I have to be honest; I noticed her shapely figure way before I noticed
                what she was doing. She was trying to get the bag into the station after swiping the metro card. As I
                approached the entrance, I couldn’t help but admire. She was dressed in a simple but elegant black dress
                which flowed gracefully over the curves of her body. I am a guy and I can’t describe this any better,
                but I can tell you, in my humble opinion, what she was wearing was nothing fancy, by any stretch of the
                imagination.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I got closer to her, I caught a whiff of her perfume which accentuated her whole
                presence. Quite suddenly, all my weariness was forgotten and rest of the mist in my head cleared out.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The girl barely glanced at my direction, as I approached the gate, but then that was
                not abnormal. I deserved a second look only when there was snot dripping out of my nose. She was
                focussed on getting the bag inside the metro station. The guards at the scanner didn’t bother to help
                her and stood there admiring the view, and I must admit, it WAS some view.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I made up my mind that I must at least offer my help.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gently tapped the lady on her shoulder and asked, “Excuse me miss, do you need some
                help with the bag?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The lady turned around with a shocked and confused expression on her face, which
                deepened after seeing my face. And what a face it was! I have seldom seen a more attractive face in
                Shanghai. She had a near-perfect face, with full lips which were partially open in surprise, a
                surprisingly perfect nose, shining straight hair that framed a beautiful oval face, sharp sparkling
                black eyes (none of those iris enhancement contacts) and near-flawless skin even without any make-up, as
                far as I can see. She was about four inches shorter than me and had a slender, graceful figure.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the expression on her face, I assumed that she didn’t understand me. I was worried
                that this would be one of those awkward situations, wherein I would make a jackass of myself since
                English is not a common language in Shanghai or China. I had taken the chance as Shanghai is better off
                when it comes to English when compared to some other places in China. The fact that I was drunk
                <em>Malayalee</em> trying to put on an American accent made things worse; Any person who understood
                normal English generally gets confused when I do my American accent, and this is when I am very sober. I
                decided to ask her once more before I made myself scarce.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Do you…”, I repeated, “need… some… help… with… the bag?” enunciating as clearly as
                possible and pausing after each phrase, this time in a serious British Accent, which usually makes
                things worse when combined with my <em>Malayalee</em> accent (which by the way, is a subject of much
                ridicule, even in India). To leave no room for doubt, I mimed each of the actions while talking. There!
                That should drive home the message, wherever she’s from and whatever language she may speak. I was
                thinking up the words in Chinese for a last-ditch attempt in case the British accent failed as well.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She studied my face for some time and stared into my eyes for about ten seconds. I
                think she was trying to gauge what sort of a person I was. Shanghai, like any other big city, is not the
                kind of place where a random person would offer help to another random person without expecting
                something in return. Trust is a currency that was rare in this part of the world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Uh… Yes… Sure, I could do with some help. Thank you”, she said partially recovering
                from the shock of some random dishevelled Indian offering help.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If you find that unbelievable, let me tell you right away, that I was really surprised
                when she accepted my offer. I was already mentally prepared to hear “No thanks” and my whole body was
                ready to shrug off the rejection and go back home. By the way, her English was perfect, with a slight
                Australian lilt to it. I had to admit her English sounded way better than mine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I flexed my muscles, sucked in my gut, bent my knees and hoisted the bag on to my left
                shoulder.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365550">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 2. Back-Breaking Help</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The bag she was wrestling with was one of those large ugly bags designed fit a large
                folding bike and it objectively weighed a ton, like it had a dead body in it. I had some difficulty in
                lifting that bag, leave alone move it. I am no weakling, but I had to strain my muscles greatly to make
                it look somewhat effortless. Thankfully, she lent me a helping hand. I thought I would surely injure my
                back or dislocate my shoulder trying to lift and move the thing, but I managed to get it inside the
                station.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Damn, I needed to quit smoking (<em>again</em>) and needed to start lifting weights
                (<em>again</em>).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She observed my efforts while standing beside me and followed me into the station after
                the bag was inside. I could see that she looked a little worried as if it might be filled with stacks of
                cash.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I stepped on to the escalator and gently set down the bag behind me. The girl stepped
                on the escalator and behind the bag. I rubbed my shoulder and back to relieve the ache in my poor
                muscles. I couldn’t help but wonder how the hell she got the bag to the X-ray machine, but my brain was
                tired and shrugged off that thought. I just wanted to get back home, take a long hot shower and sleep
                off all the weariness. I heaved the bag off the escalator just as we reached landing at the bottom and
                stumbled to the nearest seats.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I carefully placed the bag on to the platform and sat down on the seats. I had never
                truly appreciated these cold metals seats as they somehow reminded me of hospitals. That moment, I was
                grateful for these seats. The girl sat next to me, opened her handbag, put her metro card in and took
                out her cell phone. She fiddled with it for a while, and put it back into her handbag, while I rubbed my
                poor aching shoulder.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Which direction are you heading to?” I asked after she was done with her cell phone,
                still rubbing my shoulder.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am heading towards the Pudong side, Century Park to be exact”, she said pointing to
                the left. “How about you? Which way are you heading to?” she asked.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am heading the same way”, I said with the slight smile. “I live somewhere close to
                Century Park station as well.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I lived midway between the Science and Technology Museum station and Century Park
                station, but technically my apartment was right next to Century Park.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay…” she replied, after a moment of hesitation. She appeared to be in thinking, and
                she turned to me a couple of times as if to ask something. She said nothing both the times. I guessed
                that she might want some help at the metro station as well but was too embarrassed to ask me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Do you need some help with the bag… I mean, to get it into a taxi and once we reach
                Century Park?” I volunteered, though I was not sure how far, I can carry that bag. She had no reason to
                trust me, so I was ready for rejection.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Her face lit up and I knew what her answer would be even before she said, “Thank you,
                that’s most kind of you”. She pointed at the bag, “I don’t think I can get this to the taxi alone.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Taxi is a nice idea,</em> I thought. I can drop the girl back to the taxi stand,
                then head back to my little apartment in the same taxi, for a long hot shower and long sleep. As I made
                this plan, I glanced at my watch and realised that it was already a few minutes after 7:00 AM. I have
                been awake for almost 24 hours. I stifled a yawn and rubbed my tired eyes. A glance at the metro TV
                conveyed the fact that we needed to wait for another 5 minutes or so before the next train arrived.
                Exactly the right time to introduce myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am Anandapadmanabhan Nair,” I said with an awkward smile and added, “You can call me
                Anand.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Ana… nda… mana… wha… Sorry?” She asked me with a slightly bewildered look on her face.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Ah, Forget it. Just call me Anand. Everyone calls me that, that’s much easier”. I was
                quite familiar with the confusion most Chinese had with my name. Moreover, if I start correcting her
                ridiculous pronunciation, I will probably need more time than the one hour we spend on the train.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“OK, Anand it is then. It’s nice to meet you, Anand. I guess from your long name, and
                the Indian accent, that you might be an Indian” she said, pronouncing my name as Ana-and. She paused for
                a couple of seconds and introduced herself, “I am <em>Zhang Hui</em>, you can call me Nicole”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nice to meet you, Nicole. Thai and Sri Lankan people have long names as well, but yes,
                I am an Indian. From the south of India”, I responded. I burned a bit from the accent comment… Damn my
                <em>Malayalee</em> accent. I could feel the hesitation in even disclosing her name.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">We had a minute more to go before the train arrived at the platform. I knew that I
                better drag the bag near the edge of the platform so that I wouldn’t hurt myself by trying to board the
                train too fast with the bag. I took a deep breath and bent my knees a bit, yanked the bag off the
                platform, carefully carried the bag to the edge of the platform and placed it behind the yellow line. My
                right shoulder felt bruised from all that effort and I massaged my shoulder to ease the discomfort in my
                shoulder. I couldn’t feel a whole lot of muscles then.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>What the hell am I doing and why the hell am I doing this?</em> I asked myself. I
                knew from my general experience that this, whatever “this” was, was not going to go anywhere. Maybe, I
                should just make some excuse, help her get the bag into the metro and take the next train. Nothing is
                ever going to happen to me, so I guess I have to be happy with this little encounter, walk away right
                now.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Grow a spine, grow a spine… just grow a fucking spine and don’t let people use you.
                    Tell her, you need to take the next train</em>, I told myself, quite vehemently.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">That thought evaporated when Nicole walked up to me, smiled at me, and said, “Thank you
                so much, Anand. I am really grateful. You were so kind to help me.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Don’t mention it, I think it’s something people should do – help each other”, I
                shrugged it off.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I guess it is true that some men do think with their genitals and not their brains,
                especially when it comes to dealing with women. Her mere presence had already put me off guard. When she
                walked up to me and stood so close to me, my throat constricted and I started feeling dizzy and
                confused… Or it might have been all that alcohol and cigarettes. I had a crazy imagination that tended
                to run wild and would raise my hope unnecessarily, so I continued whipping myself mentally so that I
                don’t get carried away by the mere fact that a (beautiful) girl accepted my help and smiled at me.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 3. The Train Ride</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">As I was beating up myself in my head, the train arrived at the platform and Nicole
                tugged at my arm, indicating that we need to go. I guess I had a blank, brain-dead look on my face and
                she had to make sure that I have not become a zombie or something. I lifted the bag, with the now
                perfected technique of bend of knees and yank and boarded the train. Thankfully, the train was nearly
                empty. Nicole and I sat down on the nearest available seats, with the bag placed at our feet. We sat
                together, but I maintained a respectful distance as I was worried I will nod off and fall on her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole thanked me for my help again and before I could respond with a self-deprecating
                comment, she got a call. She excused herself and took the call, as the train started moving. She started
                talking in Chinese and from my experience living in Shanghai, I knew this was going to be one of those
                long calls. I believe one can estimate how long a call is going to be by estimating the length and tone
                of the first “Hey” or “Hello”. This was a long, high pitched equivalent of “Heeeeeeey” (or
                “<em>Weeeeeei</em>” in Chinese), that was about four seconds long.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Good time to check my phone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I pulled out my phone and saw that there I had got a few messages. I started checking
                and responding to my text messages on WeChat (Chinese WhatsApp / Line equivalent) and WhatsApp.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I read and replied to the messages, I started thinking about what could be there in
                the bag, after all, Nicole was extra protective about the bag. She was busy chattering (quite
                expressively) on phone and for all practical purposes, I had ceased to exist. She seemed like a normal
                Chinese girl but, I was slightly paranoid and I was more than a little worried about what could be there
                in the bag. What if she’s got a dead body inside? Have I unwittingly become an accessory to some crime?
                It certainly felt heavy enough to be a small dead body – I guess I have seen too many urban legend
                movies. This lady looked normal, was polite and friendly, but I value my life more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I glanced at Nicole through the corner of my eyes and she was talking animatedly to her
                friend, “<em>Mmnhnnh Aaha Mmnhnnh Aaha, hao de hao de dui dui dui, zhidaole ya, Ha ha ha ha… Aiya! Xiao
                    si wo le!</em> (Mmnhnnh Aaha Mmnhnnh Aaha, good good yes yes yes yes, I know, Ha ha ha ha… OMG!
                that’s so funny!)” If you lived in China, you know what I mean, and you know I’m not making this up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was completely oblivious to my presence and I decided that now is the right time to
                try and figure out what’s inside the bag. I stretched my left leg and started furtively poking the bag
                with the tip of my shoes. Whatever was inside the bag felt hard like blocks of wood and it did not feel
                like a dead body (soft and squishy, I think). I quietly breathed a sigh of relief and went back to my
                texts. Nicole was laughing again, possibly at some joke made by her friend.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One of the things that amazed me is the fact that the phone signal in the metro is
                quite good when you don’t need it, like for making useless calls, gossiping on WeChat or WhatsApp or for
                browsing Weibo (Chinese twitter) and the signal is really bad when you need it most, like when you have
                to make an urgent call or send an email to your boss or client.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As expected, since there was nothing urgent, I had a full signal and my internet was
                working perfectly. It’s only when you have urgent stuff to do that your internet will stop working or
                you will run out of battery. I unlocked my phone and saw fifty-odd messages in my MBA groups and office
                group. Before I checked all those messages, I connected to the metro Wi-Fi, because I had been data
                bingeing this whole month and didn’t have much data left. After connecting to the free Wi-Fi, I noticed
                that there was also a couple of personal messages from Allen. He was super happy to see me after a long
                time and wanted to know if I am still single. He wanted to introduce me to some of his wife’s friends.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew most of Allen’s wife’s friends, and none of them ever wanted to meet me three
                years back, so this was very confusing for me. Perhaps they are all past their thirties now and willing
                to consider me as an option. Perhaps it’s my “fancy” education in a so-called rich man’s MBA School in
                Shanghai. This had happened more frequently, especially in the past couple of years. As far as I know,
                nothing has changed in my life in this time, except finding a girlfriend around a year back and breaking
                up with her six months later. As I pondered over the mysteries of life in Shanghai and how the tables
                have turned, we arrived at People Square Metro Station – the busiest metro interchange in Shanghai and
                possibly in China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As soon as the door opened, people dashed into the metro car and dived into available
                seats around us. This is something that never ceases to amaze me in China – the way people dash into the
                metro, look around maniacally, and dive into empty seats like their life depended on it. It doesn’t
                matter how old or young you are, what profession you belong to, or what socio-economic strata you
                belong, you see this behaviour throughout China. Let me assure you this is not the crazy violent rush
                you see in India as people board buses or the general compartment in trains with people pulling and
                dragging each other like crabs in a pot, but more like an organised chaos system with no hard feelings
                or emotions, in most cases. Interestingly actual fights broke over where people got to stand.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Anyhow, I digress. By the time the train started from people square, Nicole and I were
                squeezed together by people who had dived into space on either side. Nicole dragged the bag closer to
                her and placed a hand on the bag and continued to chatter with her friend. Her presence was starting to
                affect me again and I was conscious of tiniest of things I would have normally ignored like her soft
                shoulders brushing against my shoulders and sides of her thigh pressing against my thigh. I squirmed in
                the seat and moved away from her hoping that she wouldn’t notice my movements. Unfortunately, her call
                ended at that exact moment and she noticed my movements.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="_Toc51365552">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 4. Talking About Life</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole turned her attention to me and mumbled an apology. I told her it is okay (and
                almost
                added, “I’m used to it”) and since I couldn’t think of anything else, asked her if she was from Shanghai
                or some
                other part of China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She told me she was a new Shanghainese before and that her family was originally from
                some
                small city in Zhejiang. Her family had moved to Shanghai when she was six. She had lived in Shanghai
                until she
                finished high school and moved to Australia for her undergrad and post-grad studies. She worked in
                Sydney and
                Australia for about five years before coming back to Shanghai about four years back, as an Australian
                citizen.
                Although I was nodding my head and was trying the listen, my brain was furiously trying to estimate
                Nicole’s
                age; math was never my strong point and adding up all those numbers gave me an aneurysm, but I reached a
                guestimate of 32-35. And… I also understood the reason behind her Aussie-like accent.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She told me that she was currently running her own business – one of those professional
                services that helped Chinese students prepare for undergraduate and graduate school applications to
                universities
                in US, UK, Canada Europe and Australia. She got the idea during her studies in Australia and saw that
                there was
                an opportunity for her in this segment, as she had a background in education services and there was a
                lot of
                demand from Mainland China for a western education (she was part of recruitment and admissions team for
                Melbourne University). In just under two years, she had grown her business to a premier educational
                services
                company with a solid revenue stream.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She then started questioning me about my life and work in Shanghai. I tried to engage
                her in a
                conversation, which seemed easier than normal. I told her I have been in Shanghai for more than nine
                years and I
                talked a bit about my education in Shanghai. She seemed genuinely surprised and asked more about my MBA.
                I
                downplayed it as much as possible as I barely passed and had struggled a bit to find my current job
                (wherein I
                had gone back to being an IT guy). I told her that I am just living up to the stereotype of Indians
                being in IT
                and told as little as possible about the company I worked for and my job, which was objectively not very
                interesting. I spoke about how I loved to travel around China and talked about some of the places I
                loved, like
                Huangshan or the Yellow Mountain. I was surprised to find that she had never been to Huangshan. This
                another
                thing that never ceased to surprise me – the fact that a lot of Chinese know about famous places, but
                they have
                not gone to those places. I guess familiarity does breed complacency.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was curious as to how I ended up in Shanghai, especially since most Indians she had
                come
                across wanted to immigrate to the US, UK or Australia/NZ. In a previous trip to Yiwu, she had seen a lot
                of
                Indian traders there, but she assumed that there are relatively few Indian professionals in Shanghai.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I told Nicole, how nine years back I was allowed to go to either Australia or Shanghai.
                Naturally, I had opted for Shanghai as work experience in China would look good on my resume. Also, the
                growth
                in China meant better growth opportunities for me in the future.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Of course, I didn’t disclose the fact that I was supposed to stay in Shanghai for only
                a year
                and then move to Melbourne on a more permanent basis, or that I stayed back in Shanghai initially
                because the
                world was in the sub-prime crisis and then for the sake of a girlfriend. In any case, at least on the
                paper, I
                had a good reason for staying back. I also informed her politely that she needs to update her knowledge
                base
                about Indians as there are a bunch of Indian professionals and business owners living in Shanghai. As
                far as I
                know, the numbers were in high thousands.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Sometimes, people ask the right question at the right time, that freaks the crap out of
                you.
                That’s exactly what happened at that instant.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“But more than nine years?” she asked, her eyes searching my face inquisitively, “you
                must have
                had a really good reason for staying back” she concluded, sort of knowingly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I blushed a bit and my ears burned at being caught. I recovered quickly and explained
                how I got
                promoted quickly in my company as I had helped build the relationship to three times the size in just
                two years.
                I wouldn’t be able to do that in any western market given the market dynamics. This answer sort of
                pacified her,
                and she nodded in agreement.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She asked me if I am living with my family in Shanghai and I informed her that I was
                not
                married. She seemed surprised that I was not married and she said so, as her understanding was that all
                Indian
                men and women got married off by the age of 28 and 23 respectively by their parents, relatives and
                friends
                through “forced arranged marriages”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was surprised that she knew even that much about Indian culture. To the average
                Chinese,
                India was the place where <em>Yindu Shen You</em> came from (An aphrodisiac oil that was supposedly made
                by
                Indian sages for erectile dysfunction, but most Indians have never heard of it) and the place where
                people have
                only curry to eat, that too with hand.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I told her things are changing fast in India, especially in the cities. I asked her how
                she
                knew so much about Indian culture, although it was inaccurate. She remarked that she used to interact a
                lot with
                Indians while in Australia, as there were a large group of Indian students in her university.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Before she asked any more questions, I put the ball back into her court.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, tell me, what’s there in the bag? You seemed a little concerned, when I was
                handling it
                and why take the metro at all?” I asked her directly, rubbing my shoulder for emphasis. My brain was too
                tired
                to do the diplomacy thing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She laughed and explained how she had taken an early train from Century Park to
                <em>Loushanguan</em> road to meet her vendor, as she didn’t want to get caught in the <em>Hongqiao</em>
                Airport
                traffic. She had met the vendor at the metro station and had collected 100 copies of English test
                preparatory
                materials that her company had developed. To beat the traffic from Puxi to Pudong, she took the metro
                back to
                Century Park. It had taken her “forever” to get the bag into the metro station. I admired her commitment
                to
                saving money for her business, as I would have taken a taxi back home/office.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was planning to mail these to students around Shanghai, as well as various cities
                around
                Jiangsu and Zhejiang, over the holidays. She ran the business from her apartment and also had an office
                located
                near the Shanghai Jiaotong University. As the Chinese New Year was approaching, she wanted to use the
                slack time
                to promote her business and clear the backlog. The fact that she did all this alone was a sign that she
                was
                possibly single, else there would be some other guy doing all this for her. Maybe her boyfriend was
                lying
                hungover at home or something, after all, it was the weekend. I slapped myself mentally again to remind
                myself
                to stop imagining things.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Despite the frequent reality check and mental slaps, I couldn’t help but reflect on
                what just
                happened. I mean, I never get lucky when it comes to women. I have travelled alone in trains & flights
                since my
                early teens and never, not once, I have travelled with an attractive girl. I guess it’s all a matter of
                statistics and probability in the long run. The law of averages must be catching up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was far too attractive and far too friendly for my comfort. As far as I know, I am
                neither
                very interesting nor the kind of person who rarely deserves a second glance. I was average in every
                possible
                way. For people who knew about the bell curve, I am the line that divided the curve into two – Extremely
                average. Strangely, she seemed to be genuinely interested in what I had to say and she listened to me
                with a
                smile on her face. It’s perhaps that my accent was hard to understand and funny to the listener… Or she
                was
                genuinely a nice person.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This went on long enough to the point that I started considering the possibility that
                she might
                be crazy. My accent is funny, but not that funny. I pushed that thought out of my mind as well. As far
                as I can
                see, she didn’t look crazy, so she was not talking to me because she has lost her mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also noticed that she didn’t have any ring on her finger increasing the possibility
                that she
                is probably not committed or she didn’t show that she was committed or she didn’t need a ring to show
                her
                commitment. I couldn’t believe that such an attractive girl would be single and concluded that she
                cannot be
                single.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Stop thinking</em>, I screamed at myself to just to stop this chain of thoughts.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was finding it hard to focus on what was going on in my current state. My overactive
                imagination did little to help me concentrate on what she was saying. After a while, the only thing that
                mattered to me was that she had a nice, soothing voice, and a gentle, polite manner.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My mouth felt cotton dry and there was this weird taste in my mouth from all that
                smoking and
                drinking. I desperately needed a smoke and needed a large cup of Starbucks latte. I popped another piece
                of gum
                into my mouth and chewed on it in an attempt to sweep away the rising grogginess and the weird taste in
                my
                mouth.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole was following my actions, “You know what Anand? You look like you could use a
                large cup
                of coffee.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, I NEED a cup of coffee”, I replied emphasising on the word ‘NEED’, “and a
                cigarette. As
                soon as we get your bag situation sorted out. I will get a Grande triple shot Latte and smoke a couple
                of
                cigarettes.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was hoping that she would cut in and say something like – No Anand, let me buy you a
                cup of
                coffee. This is the least I can do… for all your help.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I guess it was too much to hope for as Nicole just acknowledged my needs with a slight
                nod of
                the head and another smile. I sighed internally and accepted that I have a hyperactive imagination that
                needed
                some dialling back.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We had just started from Century Avenue metro station and the train had more or less
                emptied as
                it was also an interchange station. Generally, few days before the Chinese New Year holidays there was
                going to
                be a lot of metro traffic, with people travelling to the airport and railway station, but at that point
                of time,
                the train was empty for Shanghai standards. I could see some air hostesses and airport staff heading,
                apparently
                in the direction of Pudong International Airport. Most of the commuters were dozing in their seats or
                was
                browsing or reading the news on their smartphone. Metro TV was looping some funny videos knocked off
                from
                YouTube.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What do you plan to do during the Chinese holidays? Will you be going back to India or
                travel
                around?” Nicole asked breaking into my chain of thoughts, random observations and general craziness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Well, I really hadn’t planned anything worthwhile. Definitely not going home this
                time”, I
                replied, “I will mostly stay back in Shanghai; I might go to Hangzhou or Suzhou for a day trip and I
                most
                definitely will do some metro surfing, as I plan to leave China by the end this year. I am hoping to
                meet some
                friends who are still in Shanghai, but mostly relax and surf the metro.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I have always known that there will reach a point in time where, I will have to move on
                from
                China and now that I have spent nine years here, I have started assuming that I will be heading back
                home “this
                year”. Plus, I was tired of being alone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What do you mean by metro surfing?” she asked me as we pulled out of Shanghai Science
                and
                Technology Museum, “and, why are you leaving China?” Did I just detect a bit of disappointment in her
                voice or
                is it just my imagination? It has to be my imagination.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew that I had to drag the bag to the door as the next stop was Century Park, so I
                excused
                myself and told her that we need to get ready to get out. I got up and dragged the bag right next to the
                door so
                that I can transfer to the platform easily once I reach our stop. I rubbed my aching muscles, stretched
                my back
                and leaned against the safety railing or the safety bar for balance.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365553">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 5. The Incident</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole stood up, walked next to me and asked: “So, what is metro surfing?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was clear that she understood my hesitation in talking about whatever reason I had
                for
                wanting to leave, changed the subject with that question. Just as I started explaining what metro
                surfing is,
                the train screeched to a violent halt and Nicole was thrown forward in the momentum. She let out a
                little scream
                of surprise as she lost her balance. I moved reflexively into her path and caught her in my left arm and
                grabbed
                the safety bar with my right hand at the same instant. It was one of those moments where you were driven
                by
                intuition rather than by training, and things work in your favour. God knows that my general hand to eye
                coordination is horrible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She threw her arm around my torso and grabbed on to me tightly as I regained the
                balance for
                both of us and prepared my body for reverse momentum. The reverse momentum was equally violent and I
                could
                barely hold on to the bar and Nicole at the same time, even though she was as light as a feather.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The train was quiet for a few seconds as people regained their bearings. The air
                hostess’s
                suitcase had rolled off and she was frantically chasing the suitcase. The dozing guy was wide awake and
                looked
                around in confusion. My left hand was still wrapped around Nicole’s slender body. She held on to me
                tightly with
                both her arms and her face was cradled against my chest. We remained like that, although it was actually
                safe
                for us to let go of each other.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I became conscious of three things at the same time – that her body was moulded against
                me with
                her head buried into my chest, that the train was not moving, and that some people were staring at me. I
                am
                generally very awkward around strangers. A relative stranger holding on to me with as if her life
                depended on it
                and people staring at us, really threw me off guard. I started palpitating and broke into a cold sweat.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gently let go of Nicole, expecting her to do the same. She just held on tighter. I
                cannot
                remember a more awkward situation in my life and it was at this point I started thinking about what I
                should do.
                I was not smart enough to come up with any possible course of action.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She continued to hold me as the train engineer announced something in Chinese. I hoped
                it was
                an apology as breaking like that was a crazy thing to do to a bunch of sleepy passengers. She didn’t let
                me go
                as the train started to move again. She held on to me as the train as we pulled into the Century Park
                Metro
                Station. It was at that point, I noticed she was shaking. She ignored me as I tried to inform her that
                we have
                reached her station. She ignored the people who stepped around us and her bag and glared at us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She held on to me as the door closed and the train pulled out of the station. I relaxed
                and
                wrapped both my hands around her. I stroked her shoulders gently and told her everything is okay, and
                she can
                let go of me now. I could feel her heart thumping really hard. This was completely crazy, as I couldn’t
                understand what was going on. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t have a single sexual thought in my head, and
                I was
                more worried about Nicole and the people who were staring at me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I wish I could say that I was the hero who sprung to action and helped her but I didn’t
                do
                anything other than hold her and tried to talk to her in what I thought was a soothing manner.
                Sometimes, I am
                so awkward with women that it’s nothing short of a miracle that I have had any relationships in the
                past.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In any case, by the time we had reached the <em>Zhangjiang</em> high-tech park metro
                station,
                Nicole had stopped shaking as well. As the train pulled into the station, she squeezed me harder,
                mumbled
                something, and finally let me go. I let her go as well at the same instant. My mind was racing now, and
                I was
                certain that she’s crazy and my brain screamed at me to get out of there as fast as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry, let’s get out here, please”, said Nicole repeated in a shaky voice as she
                stepped away
                from me. Okay, so that’s what she mumbled.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She straightened up, smiled weakly and turned to face the door, which slid open a
                couple of
                seconds later. I grabbed the bag and stepped out on to the platform. There was a couple of rows of those
                hospital-like metal chairs about five paces to the right. I had almost forgotten that the bag was heavy
                but was
                quite sufficiently reminded of its weight as I limped to the chair and dumped the bag gently next to the
                chairs.
                Nicole followed me unsteadily and sat down on one of the steel chairs. I could see that there was a
                vending
                machine on the platform. I told Nicole to wait for me and that I was going to get her some water. She
                just
                nodded her head weakly. <em>What is wrong with her?</em> I thought as I walked to the vending machine
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The vending machine had some bottled water, ion drinks and some Chinese tea products. I
                selected a bottle of water and a bottle of ion drink as I was not sure what Nicole’s would prefer. I
                scanned the
                QR code for Alipay payment and waited for the authorisation. I sneaked a peek to see Nicole was sitting
                hunched
                over and biting her nails; she appeared to be in deep thought. My phone vibrated a couple of seconds
                later as
                the payment was approved and the machine dropped two bottles into the draw slot. I picked them both up
                and
                headed back to the seats.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What would you like to have, water or this ion drink?” I asked her holding up the
                stuff I had
                just bought. She quietly reached for the ion drink and took it from my hand. I sat next to her and
                opened a
                bottle of water and took a sip of the water. Nicole’s hands were shaking quite badly and couldn’t open
                the
                bottle. I set down my water bottle on the seat next to me and gently took the bottle from her hand. I
                twisted
                the cap open and handed the bottle back to Nicole, who mumbled a ‘thanks’ and started sipping the drink.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">We sat there quietly and drank from our respective bottles as trains continue to pass
                in either
                direction. I finished the water and waited for Nicole to finish her drink. My 8:00 AM weekend alarm
                started
                ringing and I killed it. Nicole didn’t seem to notice it and continued sipping on her drink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She finally finished the drink and sat there dazed, probably wondering what to do next.
                I
                gently took the bottle from Nicole’s hand. She snapped out of the daze and smiled at me again. I
                discarded the
                empty bottles in the nearest trash can and came back to where Nicole was seated. She looked much more
                composed
                and relaxed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She looked up at me, and said, “Let’s go back”.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365554">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 6. Heading Back Home</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I heaved the bag to the edge of the platform and we waited for the next train to arrive
                at the
                platform. As we waited for the train to arrive, we stole glances at each other and pretended to not
                notice each
                other. I am not sure why she did that, but I did it because (at least partially) I was trying to gauge
                if she
                was okay. I could feel the awkwardness between us that hung like the thick Shanghai smog around us and I
                was
                thinking about ways to defuse this awkwardness when our train arrived at the station.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I placed the bag next to the right side of the door and stood by it while Nicole stood
                on the
                left side and held on to the safety bar next to her. Between us, the awkwardness persisted and I was
                getting
                bored with it. I sort of understood, rather guessed that Nicole was shaken up badly by the incident.
                Personally,
                this was a minor incident, but I have already experienced a few things in life, so my bars were a little
                higher
                than some other people.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Maybe I should ask her about this… I turned to face her and found that she had the
                expression
                of a person deep in their thoughts and knew it was best not to bother her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We reached the Century park station and I followed Nicole out of the train dragging bag
                behind
                me. I placed the bag on the platform to shift the bag on to my other shoulder. The effects of lack of
                sleep, the
                alcohol and the adrenaline rush… all that was catching up with me. I couldn’t help but wonder why Nicole
                couldn’t get one of those foldable trolleys for moving around. It does look ugly and unstylish, but it
                would
                have made my life easier. To make things worse, we were far away from the escalator, like 10 meters
                “far”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I stood there wondering, <em>what next</em>, Nicole’s voice brought me back to
                earth.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Are you okay?” Nicole asked with a concerned look on her face, “You don’t look so
                good,
                Anand.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s the adrenaline rush”, I told her with a wry smile on my face… more like a bile
                rush, but
                that sounds so uncool. “I am okay. Let’s get to that escalator and get out of here”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You look a bit grey; do you want to sit down for some time?” Her concern was very
                obvious in
                her voice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was indeed feeling grey and perhaps a bit green, but I shook my head and said with a
                weak
                smile, “I am fine, let’s go find that taxi.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This obvious lie earned me another smile and we walked to the escalator.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the time we reached the escalator, I was ready to drop dead. I let Nicole go ahead
                and I
                stepped on to the escalator behind her and placed the bag on the step behind me. The instant I placed
                the bag on
                to the elevator step, everything went black for a second. I managed to grip the railing on time, and I
                guess
                Nicole didn’t notice as she was looking straight ahead. We got off the escalator and headed to the exit.
                For
                some reason, I was super motivated and super energetic as I swiped out of the station and exited the
                station
                without switching the bag between the shoulders. I might have been driven by adrenalin, as I had nothing
                else
                left in me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We got out of the station and I found that there was a long queue of taxis waiting for
                us, and
                I felt a surge of relief. After all, I don’t have to wait for a taxi and I can head back home sooner.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nicole, do you want me to come along with you, to help to get this to your
                apartment?”, I
                offered, as we approached the taxi queue. She would have been too polite to ask me anyways.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If that wouldn’t bother you too much, I could use your help”, she replied. The way she
                said
                that I felt like I was some knight in shining armour. I guess I have an honest, trustable face.
                <em>Thank God I
                    was not a psychopath.</em>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Not at all, let’s get that taxi now,” said I, as I hailed the first taxi in the queue.
                The
                taxi driver was kind enough to pull out of the queue and stop right in front of us. Maybe, he saw how
                pale I was
                and how close I was to vomiting. He opened the luggage boot and I pushed the bag into the boot. I felt
                light-headed and felt high as all sensation rushed back into my muscles. I adjusted the bag so that, the
                driver
                can close the boot.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole got into the back seat and I got in the front. Nicole told the taxi driver where
                she’s
                going to and I was surprised to find that she lived in the apartment community very close to mine. I
                told her
                that we are neighbours and I lived right behind her community.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She told me that, her parents had bought it for her when she came back to Shanghai. She
                seemed
                surprised that I lived in that community right behind the one she was staying in. I don’t blame her as
                the area
                is expensive and I just don’t look like someone who belonged there. Moreover, I was really lucky to find
                a house
                within my limited budget.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was more surprised that she was not surprised that I understood Mandarin Chinese.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, tell me Anand do you work somewhere close by?” she inquired as the taxi sped
                toward her
                community.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I confirmed that I worked in the <em>Lujiazui</em> area of <em>Pudong</em>. Satisfied
                with the
                answer, she turned back to her phone to attend to her messages. There were so many things that I wanted
                to ask
                her, starting with why she reacted the way she did on the train. I was tired beyond words, and Nicole
                was
                texting someone, so I started nodding off even though her apartment complex was less than a kilometre
                away.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365555">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 7. She Lives on the 13<sup>th</sup> Floor</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">About five minutes later we reached the apartment block and I woke up with a start. I
                am not
                sure why, but I mumbled an apology and got out of the car. The driver got out to help take the bag out
                of the
                trunk. I wanted to help him as he was a frail-looking guy and I was worried he might snap like a twig,
                but my
                worry was misplaced as the guy was as strong as an ox and hefted the bag out fairly easily. I steeled my
                core as
                he passed the bag on to my shoulder. I stood there for a second as my body got accustomed to the weight
                of the
                bag. My mid-section felt weird and I assumed that its six-packs forming on my abs due to all the strain.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I started walking slowly to the building as Nicole paid the taxi driver. As I reached
                the main
                door, some kind soul who was stepping out of the building held the door open for me, probably after
                seeing my
                face which was some shade of curry-green. I was sure I looked like I was about to vomit but took a
                couple of
                deep breaths and recovered. Nicole followed me into the building and I motioned her to lead the way.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole turned left into the corridor and I followed her, she turned left again to get
                to the
                lift bay. Thankfully, the lift was already on the first floor and Nicole hit the ‘up’ arrow to open the
                lift.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, thank you. I am not sure how to thank you”, she said with a smile on her face
                as the
                lift door opened and she got in. This is the characteristics of some of the Chinese I have come across,
                they
                thank people repeatedly for the same thing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s okay. Let’s get to the lift, the bag is a <em>bit</em> heavy”, I told her with
                a wink,
                and smile on my face as I followed her into the lift and she let out a short laugh.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I got into the lift that Nicole had held open for me. Yes, I was ungentlemanly… She
                swiped her
                access card and pressed thirteen, which I found interesting as this was the same floor I lived on. I
                decided
                against dropping the bag on the floor (I couldn’t stand the thought of lifting the bag again) and leaned
                against
                the mirrored walls of the lift. Nicole stood next to me, with a thoughtful look on her face. She was
                probably
                thinking, how best to get rid of me. It was almost funny for me and I would have laughed but that
                instant a wave
                of nausea hit me. I involuntarily groaned as I fought back the sensation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole was startled by the sound that emanated from me and turned to look at me. Her
                eyes
                became as big as a saucer when she saw my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh, your face looks green, are you fine?” she asked me, with a mix of concern and
                horror in
                her voice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am fine, I just really need to use the washroom, after I keep this in your office.
                If you
                don’t mind, may I use your washroom?” I told her as the lift stopped and dinged thirteen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Of course, you may use the washroom and… You don’t have to keep the bag into the
                office” she
                asserted. I guess, she trusted me enough to allow me, a stranger, into her home, for however brief it
                might be.
                For all you know, I could be a serial killer or a rapist, but again thank God I am not. A thought
                suddenly hit
                me – she might be one of those psychopaths who get men into her home and castrates them for revenge.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I checked my thoughts, as I came to realise that this is what the society is done to us
                – no
                one trusts no one, and no one is willing to help anyone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The lift dinged thirteen and the lift door opened silently. She stepped out of the lift
                and
                held the door open for me. I stepped out of the lift and followed her into the apartment. Thankfully her
                apartment was right next to the lift – literally, a hop, skip and jump away – not that I could hop, skip
                or jump
                with that massive bag on my shoulder. Nicole had opened the apartment door for me. I stepped into the
                apartment
                and with Nicole’s help, placed the bag down into her dining area.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The effect was magical; I felt so light that I was certain that I would levitate. I
                stood there
                for a few seconds enjoying the sensation until nausea hit me again. <em>Yup, that one is not going to
                    stay
                    down.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">“May I use your washroom, please?” I asked Nicole calmly, after gulping down whatever
                was
                rising my throat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sure, the washroom is right behind you”, she said. She took one look at me and added,
                “Let me
                get some water for you, you go ahead, okay?” She seemed genuinely concerned and I was honestly touched
                by this
                concern, even in my current state.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I walked into the bathroom as coolly as possible; what can I say? Ego can be a bitch.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I close the bathroom door and locked the door behind me. The bathroom was obsessively
                clean and
                smelled nice, the way it would for a single girl. It was all a pink blur. I knelt next to the toilet
                bowl,
                opened the lid and started vomiting into the bowl, as silently as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I heaved out whatever was there in my stomach and after about five minutes, I was done.
                I stood
                up shakily, feeling slightly better and feeling a whole lot lighter. I wiped the edges of the bowl clean
                with a
                piece of toilet paper, flushed twice, and walked to the washbasin. Everything in the bathroom came to
                focus, it
                was nauseatingly pink and well organised. I rinsed out my mouth and washed my face in the washbasin. The
                ice-cold water felt nice. I “borrowed” some of Nicole’s Korean toothpaste which was, pink and berry
                flavoured. I
                brushed my teeth with my index finger and rinse out my mouth with a Korean mouthwash.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I was gargling my mouth (as quietly as possible), I hear a gentle knock on the door
                followed
                by Nicole’s concerned voice coming through the door, “Hey, you okay in there?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I quickly and silently spat out the mouthwash, before responding, “I am fine, sorry… I
                will be
                out soon.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh no, no, no”, she replied quickly, “It’s all right, please take your time.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I washed out my mouth one last time with the ice-cold water from the tap and splashed
                some more
                ice-cold water on my face, before getting out of the bathroom.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I felt like a new man at that point.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I walked out of the bathroom to find Nicole sitting on the couch in the living room.
                Now that
                my senses had cleared up and nothing else was competing for my attention, she looked even more
                attractive.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Listen, I borrowed some of your toothpaste and mouthwash”, I said with an awkward
                smile, and
                added, “I am going to head back home now.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey, come on, that’s okay. You look much better”, she said with a smile that lit up
                the whole
                room, “I have ordered coffee for us – Two triple Grande lattes from Starbucks. I also ordered some food
                for us.
                I hope you are okay with coconut & hazelnut scones. Why don’t you have that and then go back home?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She got up from the couch as she was talking and handed me a bottle of water. <em>Damn,
                    she was
                    so nice! Or she was a total psychopath, who will castrate me after the coffee.</em> I slapped myself
                mentally and checked my thoughts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I look around the living room and saw that place was tastefully and minimally
                decorated. Most
                furniture in the living room except the couches were made with sandblasted, tempered glass, and steel.
                The
                living room was well lit and opened out to a large balcony where she had kept her foldable bike. The
                largest
                wall in her living room, the wall opposite the sofa she was seated, was covered with a topographical map
                of the
                world. It was about two meters high and four meters wide. What was interesting was that there were no
                borders on
                the map and it was shaped like a butterfly. A dozen or so photos of varying sizes were scattered on the
                map. It
                was clear that these were photos from the places she visited, and the size of the photos perhaps denoted
                the
                importance to her. I could make out Nicole’s smiling face in front the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramids of
                Giza,
                Opera House in Sydney, her silhouette in front of Angkor Vat, three or four photos in Europe (I
                recognised
                Eiffel Tower and Charles Bridge in Prague), and a scattering of photos from across the United States.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s a nice place you got here”, I said while admiring the map, “You have decorated it
                well. I
                like the idea of the map, I would probably steal this idea for my home in India.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She looked at me and for a moment I thought, I saw a flash of what I thought was
                sadness.
                Whatever the emotion was, she recovered fast.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s okay, I guess. My folks allowed me to decorate it whatever way I liked”, she said
                casually, and she changed the subject abruptly and asked me “Do you live alone or with a roommate?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I live alone”, I should have added ‘now’ to the end of that sentence, as my
                ex-girlfriend used
                to live with me on and off before my breakup about six months back, “It’s more convenient that way” I
                added,
                trying to sound casual. She nodded, hopefully in agreement with me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both fell silent for a minute, not knowing what to say. At least I didn’t know what
                to say
                and I soon discovered that she was thinking how to say what she wanted to say.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, I have been thinking”, she said breaking the silence, “If you have time, may I
                invite
                you for a lunch or a dinner? I wanted to thank you properly for your kind help.” She sounded hesitant as
                if
                she’s not used to doing this and it did look like it took a lot of courage for her to ask.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I felt my jaw drop open, and I could see Nicole blush at my spontaneous reaction. This
                day was
                getting more and more unbelievable as it went by. Thankfully, before either of us could say anything
                more, her
                phone started ringing. She looked at me briefly before answering the call. I figured out from the
                conversation
                that it was someone from the coffee store. It sounded as if the delivery guy was already on his way and
                would be
                here in ten minutes or so. I had made up my mind and waited impatiently for the call to be done.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She disconnected the phone and we both started talking at the same time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am happy…” I said and paused.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I understand if…” she said and paused.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stared at each other for about ten seconds; it felt as if we were both afraid of
                what the
                other had to say. I have no idea what she was thinking, but I knew that I had nothing to lose.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I manned up and blurted out, “Thank you for your invitation. I am okay for lunch or
                dinner…
                whenever you have time.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She seemed pleased with my response, and with her head tilted to the ceiling started
                thinking
                aloud, “Next week is Chinese New Year; I can finish the work this week. I am not travelling anywhere, so
                I’m
                free for the whole of next week. Let’s meet sometime next week. Can I have your cell number and WeChat
                ID?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gave her my number and showed her my WeChat QR code, and she added me on WeChat. She
                gave me
                a missed call and I saved her number. For the next ten minutes, we did what everyone does after adding a
                new
                WeChat contact – look at other person’s moments (which is sort of like an inbuilt Instagram feed) and
                spy on
                each other’s lives shamelessly. Her moment posts were mostly work-related. My social media contents were
                more
                personal than work. This might be the biggest difference when you work for yourself versus when you work
                for
                others – you use your social media to grow your business rather than posting useless crap like food and
                travel
                photographs, the way I do.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Our breakfast arrived right about the time I came to the above conclusion, which helped
                avoid
                further awkward conversations. Nicole had ordered some red bean scones for herself along with hazelnut
                and
                coconut scones for me. We enjoyed a quiet breakfast, and the coffee helped clear some more of that fog
                in my
                head. In the back of my mind, something didn’t compute and I felt there was something amiss here. Things
                like
                this never happened to me, period. I tried to push out the negative thought and tried to go with the
                flow.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We were unnaturally comfortable with each other when we were discussing life in
                Shanghai, which
                was very rare for me when it came to strangers. What I discovered as we ate was the fact that we were
                unnaturally comfortable with each other’s silence as well, which was even rarer with me. I took a pause
                there
                and reminded me that, I was getting ahead of myself. I don’t see a girl like Nicole would want anything
                to do
                with someone like me; I have learnt this from experience.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We ate in silence and continued to spy each other’s WeChat Moments. Soon, there were a
                lot of
                likes popping up on my post, especially my photography posts. Most of Nicole’s posts were in Chinese and
                there
                were some posts which I could understand and I liked those, mostly because I was pleased with my ability
                own to
                read some simple Chinese. There were hardly any photos of herself, except a few photos from team
                dinners. She
                appeared to be a very private person, who shared things very selectively from her personal life or I was
                overly
                social media dependant and Nicole was a normal person who didn’t feel the urge to post everything from
                her life.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finished the scones and waited for Nicole to finish the scones, which was less than
                half done
                by the time I finished the whole scone. She asked me if it was getting late for me. I assured her that I
                don’t
                have anywhere to go and I am okay to wait until she was done with her scone. I could see that she was
                pleased
                with that response and continued to nibble on her red bean scone and sip her coffee.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Since we were being so friendly and I was no longer sleepy, I thought I should ask her
                why she
                reacted the way she did, on the train.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey… Nicole, can I ask what happened on the train? I mean, you were pretty shaken up
                and if
                you want to talk about it, I am happy to listen”, I inquired as gently as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She looked at me with those beautiful liquid black eyes, but it felt as if she’s trying
                to look
                into my heart and soul. Clearly, she was deciding what to say. For some reason, I knew that she wasn’t
                angry at
                me and I knew that I hadn’t screwed up yet. Something in her eyes conveyed that message. If anything,
                she was
                sad and I felt this wave of compassion for her. I wanted to hold her and tell her everything okay, and I
                would
                have done so if I knew her longer than three hours; I don’t want to be seen as someone who takes
                advantage of a
                woman in a weak moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After what felt like an eternity, she sighed and said, “Let’s talk about this when we
                meet for
                dinner, okay? I don’t want to keep you waiting.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew from her tone that, she needed some time to compose her thoughts or she was
                politely
                telling me not to pursue that line of thought. I needed some sleep in any case, so I nodded in agreement
                and
                added, “Sure, let’s talk about it whenever you feel like to talking about it.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You told me that you will be shipping out the material, will you be doing that
                yourself?” I
                added, mainly to change the subject.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, just me”, she replied, “I can do the packaging and call the <em>Zhongtong</em>
                guy to
                come and pick up the packages here.” She sounded relieved that we changed the subject.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A thought was forming in my mind, but I had no idea how to express it properly. A
                cigarette
                would have helped. She continued to nibble her scone and sip the coffee.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I took a sip of the lukewarm coffee, and asked hesitantly, “Do you need some help to do
                the
                packing? I have pretty much nothing to do, and if you don’t mind, I can come over and help you.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hmm, let me think about it”, she said. In China ‘<em>let me think about it</em>’
                generally
                meant, ‘<em>No</em>’.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Didn’t you say you are planning to do…” she quickly added with a tilt of her head
                trying to
                recall whatever I said “What did you call it… Ah yes, Metro Surfing? What exactly is that?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I know, she wanted a subject change and I respected her desire not to accept my offer
                to help.
                A girl like Nicole must have hundreds of men falling over themselves to “help” her, especially in China
                where
                the sex ratio is as bad as it is in India. The average Shanghainese man does everything for their
                beloved wife
                or girlfriend (or both) and goes to great extent to keep their wife or girlfriend (or both) happy. They
                would
                buy apartments worth millions of RMB, cars, car licence plates and luxury good for their loved one. They
                are
                okay to cook, wash, clean, and do most of the housework to keep their respective wives happy. In
                comparison, an
                Indian IT guy who believes in gender equality and sharing responsibilities equally doesn’t stand a
                chance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Ah yes, during the Chinese New Year holidays, you know that most people would go back
                to their
                home, leaving large cities like Shanghai relatively empty” I started explaining and Nicole nodded her
                head in
                agreement.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“As I have pretty much nothing to do, and since the metro would be empty, I use this
                time to
                travel end-to-end on all 13 metro lines, the <em>Zhangjiang</em> tram, and the Maglev” I continued to
                explain,
                “It should take about 2 or 3 days. At the terminal stations of each of these lines, I would take a photo
                as
                proof of my journey.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I started explaining my idea, I realised how silly it sounded when I said it out
                loud. Any
                normal person would use this time to travel around, soak in some culture, and get drunk with buddies at
                your
                favourite pub or something like that. But then… I have not been normal for a very long time. Nicole
                stared at me
                incredulously and I started blushing again. It felt as if, any moment now, Nicole would burst out
                laughing on my
                face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I don’t think even the local Shanghainese people would have travelled on all metro
                lines,
                especially end-to-end”, Nicole said, her face inscrutable, “I look forward to seeing those photos on
                your WeChat
                moments.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Even though her face was inscrutable, she sounded genuine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sure, I will probably do this on the weekend before the <em>Chuxi</em>”, I said,
                <em>Chuxi</em> being the eve of Chinese New Year’s.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both took a sip of coffee from our respective cups and, Nicole continued to nibble
                her
                scone. It was almost done... but she was so slow that I wanted to shake her by her shoulder and tell her
                “Just
                put that scone out of its misery!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My phone vibrated in my pocket making me jump; I had forgotten about its existence.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Excuse me”, I said and took out my phone to see that there were 8 or 9 WeChat messages
                from
                Allen. For a good measure, he had messaged a couple of ‘Dude, you there?’ messages on WhatsApp and
                iMessage
                (which was the reason the phone vibrated). He was under a lot of pressure from his wife to set me up
                with her
                friend for a coffee meet. His wife (apparently) felt that we are very suitable together and was pissed
                off at
                Allen that he didn’t broach this subject with me, even though we hung out the whole night and despite
                her
                constant reminder.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were a couple of ‘Beautified’ photos of the girl. The girl was very pretty, but
                then
                after meeting Nicole, this girl didn’t even come close. I know… I am very superficial. Allen was one of
                the
                first friends in Shanghai and I owed him a lot. Also, the possibility of meeting a pretty girl like that
                is so
                low in my life that I agreed to meet her. Just to be done with it, if not anything else.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As soon as I sent the message, I put the phone on Do Not Disturb mode and laid it face
                down on
                the table, next to the coffee cup.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Meanwhile, Nicole had finished her scone was sipping the coffee, and was waiting for me
                to be
                finished with the message.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365556">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 8. The Grass is Greener</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">“Why do you want to leave China? Don’t you like it here?” Nicole asked me, very
                abruptly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">At first, I thought she was angry at the fact that an Indian didn’t like China, but
                then it was
                more of a curiosity that I saw on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The usual answer I gave people if they ask me this question was that I am heading back
                home and
                start something by myself. This answer was sellable, as I had enough work experience and I had an MBA
                from one
                of the best B-schools in China. You do an MBA, start a business, call yourself CEO, and throw around a
                few
                jargons… it is only logical. While I was considering which version to present, Nicole waited expectantly
                for my
                answer. My intuition told me honesty is the best policy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If you don’t want to talk about it, it’s okay”, Nicole said sensing my hesitation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“No, it’s not that… The usual answer for that question is – I would like to go back to
                India to
                start my own business”, I paused to take the last sip of the coffee and continued, “But the reality in
                short is,
                I am tired of being alone here, nothing more and nothing less. I am tired of all these… uh… short-term
                relationships. If I head back home, I have my parents, my sister, and my extended family to look forward
                to.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Back there, I might even find that life partner that I have been looking for… Someone
                with
                shared background and culture. It’s time, to be honest with myself, I might have been looking in the
                wrong
                places and might have been approaching this relationship thing all wrong… Plus I sort of miss home”, I
                concluded
                hesitantly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Whatever I said had struck a chord, as Nicole seemed genuinely surprised and her lips
                were
                parted in surprise. This must be her version of dropping the jaw. The parted lips made her look like a
                model,
                getting ready for a shot. My throat constricted a bit at that image, and my heart skipped a beat. I
                gulped down
                that ball of emotions stuck in the throat, fake coughed into my balled fist and broke eye contact with
                her in
                the process. I prayed for her to close her lips or start talking. She looked even more angelic.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I know how that feels!” she exclaimed finally, her face slightly flushed, “This is why
                I came
                back to Shanghai. I always felt alone no matter how many ever friends I had or how many other Chinese or
                Shanghainese people were there in Sydney. I hated the fact that I missed my family so much all the time.
                I hated
                how people judged me for being a woman and whatever I achieved, was attributed to my looks. I hated
                myself for
                getting into relationships with these so-called perfect guys who were, in the end, nothing but
                superficial and
                vain. It seemed like all they wanted was… sex and money.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I wanted to become Australian so bad, but after that happened, I realised that I am
                more or
                less the same person. A friend of mine had told me once – <em>You can take me out of China, but you
                    cannot take
                    China out of me.</em> I used to laugh at her, but God knows she is right. I am Australian now, and I
                did it
                by myself, but apparently, that was not enough for me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I thought that living in Sydney was getting to me and moved to Melbourne, thinking the
                change
                would help. Not. One. Bit” she said, emphasising each word. She paused for a moment, as if deciding how
                to put
                her thoughts into words, and continued, “I missed Shanghai and China even more. Don’t get me wrong, I
                like being
                an Australian citizen and I like the fact that I have the freedom to travel anywhere I want, but home is
                home.
                Finally, after more than 12 years in Australia, I made up my mind to go back to Shanghai. I knew that I
                can find
                something to do in Shanghai, and in the worst-case scenario, I can live off my parents’ money. They had
                loads of
                money in any case and they used to tell me often that I really didn’t need to work”, she paused and
                laughed at
                her own joke.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I smiled because she was genuinely happy, and not because her joke was funny – I didn’t
                get the
                joke anyway.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She took the last sip from the cup and finished off the coffee. She studied the lip of
                the
                coffee cup for a few seconds. She seemed lost in some thought. I tried to see what she was looking at.
                Might be
                the outline of her lip balm. One instant, my eyes were focussed on the lip of her cup and in the next
                instant,
                my eyes focused on her lips. This was the first time I noticed that she had a tiny mole on the right
                side of her
                lips. Before she snapped out of her reverie, I quickly looked down and pretended to study my
                fingernails. I
                didn’t want to see the phone as I was scared of seeing more messages with more requests from Allen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She finally let out a loud sigh and relaxed her whole body. I looked up and, she
                concluded, “To
                be honest, this business was something that just happened. I was in the right place at the right time. I
                know I
                shouldn’t be laying this out on you but, it feels good to talk without any strings attached.” All this
                tumbled
                out, and I got a feeling that she had seldom talked about this. I am not sure why she felt she could
                talk about
                this with me and talk so much, but she was transformed completely and seemed free of tension. The
                sparkle in her
                eyes intensified to the point where I couldn’t meet her eyes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Don’t even mention it, I am glad that you could talk to me, a complete stranger”, I
                responded
                with a smile while thinking – <em>Damn, I should have shared more</em>. Nicole excused herself and got
                up to go
                to the bathroom and I started thinking about what Nicole just told me. After what I heard from Nicole,
                it did
                appear that the grass was not greener on the other side after all. Given the extremely average nature of
                my life
                and looks, I have always envied and admired attractive people. They just seem more confident and
                comfortable in
                their skins. Come to think of it, attractive people have no choice but to be confident; their confidence
                is what
                makes them attractive. It might be a self-fulfilling prophecy for them.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I always felt that attractive people can never be alone, but after listening to Nicole,
                I could
                feel how lonely they could get. They might have people around them and they might have a well-practised
                smile on
                their faces, but inside they could be the loneliest of the people on earth. Agreed that everyone is
                different,
                and Nicole is not a representation of everyone, but I am sure that certain things might be common
                amongst such
                people. What I realised is that they might be judged for everything they do – Their choice of a partner,
                their
                choice of friends, and perhaps even their choice of what they eat or wear. Their partners will never be
                attractive enough, their friends might not be true friends and their choice of foods or clothing seen as
                snobbish. It’s truly a lonely place to be in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When I said, I felt lonely, if I am honest to myself what I mean to say is - <em>I
                    don’t have a
                    girlfriend and my prospects of finding one are really low, no matter where I go</em>. In reality, I
                do have
                a lot of amazing friends in Shanghai and all over China, since I have lived here long enough. Most of
                them
                accepted me for the person I am, the rest of them outright loved me for my clumsy efforts to learn the
                language
                and the fact that I eat <em>FengZhua</em> or chicken feet every single time I go to a dim sum
                restaurant.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">On the contrary, with Nicole, who was in my humble opinion, the representation of
                attractiveness, what I saw in that moment of vulnerability was a person who desires something I had, and
                I had
                not learned to cherish – a normal, average life. This was possibly just my feeling, but I also had a
                feeling
                that I was right. For the first time since we met, I tried to look beyond her looks and the recently
                discovered
                fact that her family has loads money, both which were objectively the hardest thing I did in my whole
                life. I
                was born with the gift of self-awareness, and I was painfully aware of my capabilities and shortcomings.
                This
                helped me accept the fact that Nicole probably needed someone who’s painfully self-aware to talk to so
                that the
                guy wouldn’t start hitting on her. I let out a sigh as reality hit me with the force of a slamming door.
                At
                least I will not have too many false hopes; no more of that imagined ‘comfortable with each other’ crap.
                In my
                life, it was stupid to expect anything different.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Coming back to the present and the now, I was super sleepy, super tired and super
                deprived of
                nicotine. No amount of coffee or beautiful women was going to help me now. I needed some sleep. Nicole
                came back
                with a smile on her face which said one thing – she wanted to talk more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nicole, it was really great talking to you, but I don’t really want to hold you up. I
                will
                head back home now. Thank you so much for the coffee and scones, I feel like a new man”, I told her
                standing up
                before she could start talking again. It came out too abrupt for my own liking… Damn my low Emotional
                Quotient!
                She seemed sort of disappointed, but she recovered quickly. Perhaps, she wanted to talk more… I had
                tried hard
                to look perky and alert, but my bloodshot eyes and dark circles said a different story. She could see
                how tired
                I was with my sagging shoulders and grey face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You do look really tired,” she said as she stood up and added “I don’t want to keep
                you here
                for long, but I have not been able to talk to anyone the way I talked to you and it feels good. I like
                the fact
                that you are a good listener. If you don’t have anything to do, can we meet tomorrow evening itself for
                the
                dinner? I would like us to talk more. I am thinking, we can go to the Blue Frog at 96 Plaza. We can meet
                here
                at, say 5 PM and share a ride”, she concluded and waited for my response.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This time, my jaw didn’t drop, but my thoughts went haywire for a couple of seconds.
                <em>I am a
                    good listener!? That’s called being dumbfounded</em>, I thought. Maybe it’s my eyes… I have been
                told time
                and again that my eyes are way above average and exuded kindness, like a dachshund puppy.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am free tomorrow and yes… We can surely meet tomorrow for dinner”, said I trying to
                suppress
                the ear-to-ear grin that was forming on my face. I was free on most evenings, why would she ever think
                that I
                have anything to do? Cracked me right up, but I managed successfully to suppress that grin down to a
                polite,
                albeit a bit tired, smile.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She didn’t make any attempt to suppress her own happiness. She smiled an ear-to-ear
                grin and
                reached to hug me, and mumbled, “Thank you, Anand. You are very kind.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hugged her back, and interestingly, I wasn’t physically aroused by the hug. On the
                contrary,
                I felt protective of her and knew in that instant, this goes beyond the normal physical relationship
                defined by
                hormones and known sciences. I had read somewhere that you spend a lifetime getting to know a person and
                still
                not know the person, and some other cases in some cases you get to know the person in an instant,
                instinctually.
                I might be wrong, but I knew in that instant that Nicole is a genuine person and I knew that we can be
                good
                friends. I released her after two-and-a-half Mississippi and told her, “You are most welcome, Nicole.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">She let go at the same time; perhaps she was counting as well. She walked to the door
                and
                opened the door for me. I stepped out of her apartment and pushed the lift call button. She stood there
                smiling
                and, as I got into the lift told me, “Take care Anand, rest well, and see you tomorrow.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“See you tomorrow”, I called out as I entered the lift and pressed the button for the
                first
                floor.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 9. Heading Back Home</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">As soon as I stepped out of Nicole’s apartment building, I fished out my cigarette
                pack, lit up
                a cigarette and started walked back home, which was about ten minutes by walk or five minutes by bike
                from
                Nicole’s apartment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was more or less on auto-pilot and took me about fifteen minutes by walk to get to my
                apartment block. I was fairly certain that I looked like a zombie by the time I reached there, with dark
                circles
                under my eyes and an intense stare as I tried to focus on the world around me. I smoked one more
                cigarette
                outside the block in the cold before heading up to my apartment, which was also on the thirteenth floor.
                What
                can I say? I am the “superstitious” types and wanted to see what happens if I lived on the thirteenth
                floor.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I entered my cold apartment, turned on the living room & bedroom room heaters to full
                blast and
                sank into the couch in my living room. My body relaxed as some of the tension and tiredness eased out my
                aching
                muscles. I looked around my sparse, yet fairly tidy one-bedroom apartment and realised for the first
                time that I
                needed to spruce up the place. It was designed to be functional, rather than attractive.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As you enter the Spartan flat, you would notice a tiny dining area to the left and a
                small
                walk-in kitchen right next to the dining area, again to the left. The house owner was kind enough to
                install
                IKEA wall cupboards in the dining area that I used for storing my nuts, oats, protein powder, a couple
                of bowls
                & plates, some Rubbermaid and Tupperware boxes and some bare minimum cutlery. The kitchen was a bit
                crowded as I
                liked to cook whenever possible and was usually well-stocked. On the right side of the entrance was an
                average-sized bathroom, which had a basic washbasin, a western commode, an automatic washing machine
                above which
                rested a tiny tumble dryer and, next to the western commode was the enclosed shower area.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You would walk into a large well-lit living room once you cross the dining area and
                bathroom,
                which was furnished with a two-piece IKEA sofa set, coffee table and a TV stand (both again from IKEA).
                On the
                aforementioned TV stand rested one of my larger purchases, a Mi branded 55-inch 4K LED Smart TV with Mi
                branded
                soundbars. The house owner gave me a DVD player, next to which was my pile of DVDs, which was the only
                thing
                that was not very well organised in my apartment. Beyond the living room was a four-square-meter balcony
                where
                there was a pulley operated clothesline, and a small foldable lawn table and chair from IKEA. The
                balcony faced
                the street, and beyond the street was the apartment complex that Nicole lived in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The bedroom was on the right side of the entrance and right next to the living room and
                was the
                second largest space in the apartment. This space doubled up as my study as well. My landlord had
                provided me
                with a queen-sized bed, and two small nightstands. On the left nightstand was my old iPad Air, my Bose
                SoundLink
                Mini II, and a power strip with my iPhone charger. Right next to the bedroom door was a large closet. In
                the
                corner at the end, next to the window was my study space, which was a complicated computer table I
                acquired in
                one of the WeChat second-hand groups and an ergonomic swivel chair I got on discount at IKEA. My other
                big-ticket purchases were on the computer table, a 2015 13-inch MacBook air, a Bluetooth Keyboard, a
                Microsoft
                Designer Mouse and a 25-inch LED display from Dell.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The only real decoration in the whole house was a black and white panorama of the
                Forbidden
                Place.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">So here I was, sitting on the couch and trying not to nod off. I needed to use the
                toilet,
                brush my teeth properly as there is only so much chewing gum or index finger brushing can help. I also
                could do
                with a shower and a scrub down as I was starting to smell… very musky, to put it politely.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I removed the extra layers of clothing, except the pullover, slipped out my jeans and
                slipped
                into my shorts. My shoes went into the shoe cabinet by the door and I slipped on a pair of loafers. I
                hung my
                jacket out on the balcony, and I piled the rest of the clothes into my washing machine. I needed a black
                coffee
                and cigarette before I can go to the toilet, so I paddled to the kitchen and made a cup of sweet instant
                coffee.
                I never smoked in the house, so I stepped out into the cold balcony to smoke a couple of cigarettes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I set down the coffee on the coffee table, quickly lit the cigarette with my shaking
                hands and
                started smoking furiously. The steaming coffee gave some respite from the cold. Half-way through the
                second
                cigarette, I was ready. I finished the cigarette and coffee and headed back in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I grabbed a towel on my way to the toilet. I turned on the heater in the bathroom,
                stripped off
                the rest of the clothes and dumped all of them except my shorts into the washing machine. It was then
                noticed
                red bruises on either shoulder, the bag strap had bruised my skin and from the depth of its colour, it
                looked as
                if, the bruise should take some time to disappear. I looked at myself and thought <em>No hot shower
                    today, need
                    a cold shower to ensure proper muscle repair.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t have any time to admire myself; I had to go to the toilet now. Five minutes
                later, I
                was done with my ‘business’ and leisurely brushed my teeth. I noticed that my stubble was a bit too
                long, but I
                decided that I can wait until tomorrow morning for that shave.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I turned on the shower faucet to hot and let it run for a few minutes and turned it
                back to the
                neutral position to get a cold, but not icy cold, shower running, I guessed the temperature to be at
                around
                15-16 degrees. I hung the towel on the hook behind the door and stepped into the cold torrent. I felt
                the cold
                water cutting into my skin and let the tiredness seep out of my body. I let the cold-water flow over my
                sore
                shoulders and felt the pain and soreness easing off. I stepped out from under the shower to shampoo my
                hair and
                to scrub myself. I immediately started shaking and shivering as the cold hit me again, despite the fact
                the
                heater was running in the bathroom. I quickly shampooed my hair and scrubbed up my body with a soap bar
                before
                getting back under the shower again to wash off the suds.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As soon as I was done with the shower, I stepped out of the shower and dried myself off
                with
                the towel. I was shaking like a leaf and I allowed my body to get used to the cold. I wrapped the towel
                around
                my waist and made a beeline to my bedroom.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I quickly got into my sleeping gear – shorts and t-shirt and slipped under the quilt. I
                plugged
                in my iPhone changer to my phone, turned on the Bluetooth, paired it with my SoundLink Mini II and
                started
                playing <span class="small-caps">Atomos</span>. There were a lot of messages on the phone which I
                ignored. I
                turned off the Wi-Fi and cellular internet to ensure that I don’t get any more messages. To ensure that
                I don’t
                get disturbed by spam calls, I kept the Do Not Disturb mode on. My parents and close friends know that
                when they
                need to reach me, they would let the phone ring three times, disconnect and then call me again to bypass
                the Do
                Not Disturb. Others can wait.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As it was well past 11 AM now, I slipped on an eye mask to block out the light and
                turned into
                the right position for my sleep, which so happened to be sleeping on my right side. The combination of
                tiredness, the soothing music, and the eye mask was super effective and I drifted off into a deep sleep
                in less
                than five minutes.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 10. The Cure for A Hangover</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I was finally fully awake. It was around quarter to seven in the evening. I got out of
                my bed
                with a throbbing headache that I have been trying to ignore since about six PM. It was useless, no
                matter how
                hard I tried to go back to sleep, it was just impossible. It was like being in limbo. It was also as if
                someone
                was playing the drums on my head with a hammer as you see in Tom and Jerry cartoons.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Everything was out of focus for half a minute. My stomach grumbled from all the acidity
                and
                bile. I needed coffee with a dash of Irish cream and a double cheeseburger with a side of fries, but
                none of
                that fast food crap, a good handmade burger, maybe at a Blue Frog or Beef & Liberty.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">First things first, that coffee first… Maybe I should skip that Irish cream. Better to
                work up
                some sweat rather than get more booze into the system. Come to think of it, maybe I should skip the
                burger too.
                I should rather go and get some peanut sauce noodles from <em>Dingtele</em>, a local Shanghainese noodle
                joint
                that is as loved by the locals as it is hated by the outsiders. The place was budget-friendly and
                healthier when
                compared to a double cheeseburger at the Blue Frog or Beef & Liberty. I was one of the few foreigners
                who
                regularly ate at <em>Dingtele</em> and the people who worked there knew what I liked to eat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I made a coffee and drank it as quickly as possible without burning myself. I washed my
                face
                and brushed by teeth quickly. I ignored the phone, as I knew that the moment I turned the internet back
                on, I
                will get sucked into messages and news alerts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had a pull-up bar installed in my living room, to the chagrin of my landlord. I
                quickly
                slipped on a pair of gym shorts and my training shoes. I did a quick warm-up and dived right into a
                circuit
                workout of 50 assisted pull-ups and push-ups in a pyramid of 20, 15, 10 and 5 reps. This was followed by
                a
                high-intensity interval training of 100 sit-ups, 100 prisoner squats, and 50 burpees. I concluded the
                training
                with three rounds of planks and side planks – one minute for the planks, 30 seconds each on both sides
                and 20
                seconds of rest. Including all the breaks, it took me 45 minutes to complete. Not my best performance,
                but it
                was good enough to work up a decent amount of sweat. The hangover had settled down to a dull throb, and
                the
                nausea was history. I cooled down and mopped away the sweat using a gym towel. I was tempted to look at
                the
                phone and check all the messages, but I held back as touching the phone would delay me at least 15-30
                minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After about 10 minutes of cooling down, I went into my shower and took an icy cold
                shower that
                helped with some of the soreness in the muscles. The redness on either shoulder had faded a bit. Looks
                like the
                recovery should happen quicker than expected. I stepped out of the shower and towelled myself dry,
                shivering all
                the while until my body ‘normalised’.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I dressed up quickly and layered myself with enough clothes to ensure that I don’t
                freeze on
                the way to the noodle joint. I grabbed a thick jacket from my closet and my bag next to my study table
                as I
                headed out. It was about quarter past eight and I decided against biking to the metro station as I was
                not sure
                if I can get the last train back home.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As soon as I got out of my apartment block, I put on my earphones, started playing some
                music
                and broke into a jog towards the metro station. I loved the feeling of the crisp Shanghai air breeze
                rushing
                past my face. I inhaled deep and burst out into a sprint; I ran flat-out for 30 seconds, before slowing
                back to
                a gentle jog. The heavy breathing forced more oxygen into my bloodstream, which helped push out any last
                remnants of hangover out of my system.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">About five minutes later, I was at the metro station, feeling a bit out of breath, and
                I was
                thinking <em>I need to quit smoking</em>. I passed through the security and entered the metro station in
                time to
                get a train heading towards people square. The train was surprisingly empty, and I found an empty seat.
                It was
                time to check all the messages now. I turned on the Wi-Fi and cellular internet on my phone and
                connected to
                Shanghai metro’s ‘Peanut Wi-Fi’. I also turned off Do Not Disturb mode. The moment the phone connected
                to the
                Wi-Fi, an avalanche of messages and notification hit the phone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I cleared all the notifications and opened up WhatsApp to check all my ‘international’
                messages. There were a few messages in my family group and MBA group, but no personal messages or
                nothing I
                needed to bother with. All was well internationally, at least in my little slice of the world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I checked my text messages next. There were a few promotional text messages from my
                banks and
                the telecom company, again nothing that I needed to pay attention to. I took a few seconds to mass
                delete some
                of the old messages that have been accumulating in my inbox since forever.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finally turned my attention to WeChat, which had around 30 unread notification, and
                this
                excluded the group messages which were all muted. There were few personal messages from a couple of
                friends, but
                most messages were from Allen and Nicole. There were also three pending friend requests as well. I
                started going
                through all the group messages first. The international MBA group had a heated discussion around the
                contrast
                between US politics and China politics. Being an Indian, I had no dog in that fight. Plus, politics
                bored the
                life out of me. I was partial towards one-party politics as it seemed to reduce a lot of management
                overheads
                and given that the US just elected a controversial undiplomatic president, I was not sure how people
                could still
                talk about merits of US politics, but I kept my opinions to myself. I didn’t want to go poke the
                hornets’ nest
                and get stung in my ass (because I am running away). My MBA class group was busy with messages about our
                upcoming reunion party. I checked the messages to confirm that the reunion party was indeed free and
                signed up
                in a jiffy. An Indian never misses a free party, doesn’t matter if he or she has immigrated to a
                different
                country or if he or she is only part Indian. As long as there is some Indian in you, you are bound to be
                there.
                Just a personal view though, and not a generalisation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The second-hand group that I was part of and sometimes moderated had some fun going on
                with
                some Indian guy calling out some Chinese guy trying to sell an ancient MacBook air for nearly USD 600.
                Some
                other Chinese guy had come out in support of his fellow Chinese and claimed that price was “reasonable
                for a
                laptop in mint condition and is 90% new”, and the Indian was throwing tantrums as the laptop “was over 5
                years
                old, and how the hell can it be 90% new”. I wanted to support the guy, but he seemed unbalanced and was
                posting
                photos and screenshots from Chinese second-hand sites like ganji.com to prove that USD 600 was a
                rip-off. I
                guess it did prove his point, but I hoped that he chilled out a bit and took life less seriously. I
                silently
                wished him luck and cleared out the messages from the remainder of the chat groups which were either in
                Chinese
                or were not interesting for me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were a few broadcast messages with Chinese New Year messages. I copy-pasted the
                same
                reply to all the messages – “<em>Wish you the same. Gong Xi Fa Cai :-)</em>”. You reap what you sow. One
                of the
                messages had my name in it, so I typed out a personal message – the above message with the recipient’s
                name in
                it – and I ensured that the smiley face was there at the end of the message. A smiley face in a message
                makes
                everything better. Type a sarcastic or snide reply to some stupid message and add a ‘:-)’ at the end.
                <em>Voila</em>! The message looks much better than the original message.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Finally, I was down to the messages from Allen, Nicole and the three new friend
                requests, but
                according to the recorded announcement, the train was just pulling into the people square station. It
                was around
                half-past eight now and quite a few passengers made toward the exit. I locked the phone, put my
                backpack, got
                out on to the platform and started walking towards the line 1 or the red line platform.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The walk to line 1 platform was lonelier than what I was used to, not the peak people’s
                square
                crowd where everyone is stumbling and pouring over each other. If I am on time to get the train back
                home, I am
                sure that I can see the rush to get the last-minute train. Come to think of it, might as well try to get
                the
                last train. I remembered that the metro service was extended by half an hour on the weekends,
                <em>Yay</em>. One
                of the signboards along the interchange corridors did confirm the last train is indeed 30 minutes later
                on
                Fridays and Saturday. This meant that I can most possibly make the last train back home.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">This is good news for me. I always do a time-lapse video of getting out of line 1 and
                transferring to line 2. Today I can do that, and share onto WeChat, Instagram and Facebook. What can I
                say? I am
                a “like monger”. That reminded me that I need to check my Instagram and Facebook as well. With that
                happy
                thought, I had reached the Line 1 platform.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The metro TV confirmed two things, that I have to wait for about 2 minutes for the
                train
                towards South Huangpi road station, and that the metro service is in weekend mode and is extended by
                half an
                hour. In a place where English is rarely spoken, and where your local language skills are at best basic,
                it is
                always better to safe to be double sure.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I unlocked my phone again and opened WeChat. I looked at the invitations and two of
                them were
                my MBA School’s new intakes – They probably added me from one of the MBA groups. I accepted their
                request
                knowing very well that they might be only connecting with me as they are looking for internships or
                jobs, not
                that I could help them. The third one was from a lady I didn’t recognise. Like some of the Chinese
                people, she
                didn’t use her name to identify herself and had used some phrase that was supposed to make them look
                “intelligent”, I guess. To confuse the poor foreigner more, instead of a full-face profile, she had a
                photo
                taken from behind with her facing the sun, so all you can make out is the silhouette – This usually
                means they
                think they are beautiful and are worried that bad men will bother them by adding them. Thankfully, there
                were
                three greeting messages in English and that made me feel slightly better.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Strange Phrase in Chinese (WeChat): Hi, I am Alice Wang.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was the first greeting. This was sent at about 1 PM.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Strange Phrase in Chinese (WeChat): I am Allen’s wife Jean Li’s friend, Nice to
                meet you
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Said the second greeting. This was sent at around 2 PM.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Strange Phrase in Chinese (WeChat): Ok, maybe you are busy, message me when you
                have time
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">That was the final greeting sent at around 3 PM.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Interesting… It almost looked like she was waiting for my response.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I accepted the friend request immediately and texted her back.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hi Alice, thank you for adding me. Yes, Allen did tell me
                about you.
                I was sleeping when you messaged me. Very nice to meet you :-)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t wait for her reply and went back to other messages. I was scared of what
                Nicole
                messages had to say. What if she had texted to say something like “Sorry, but something came up, can we
                meet
                later?” or something worse like… “I don’t think we should be friends as I’m attracted to you”, so I
                checked
                Allen’s messages as I got into the train that just arrived at the platform.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Allen’s had sent nine text messages, starting a couple of minutes past 11 AM. I might
                have just
                missed his message. The first message thanked me for “dragging his ass back home”; Second and third
                message
                cursed me for ‘borrowing’ his Irish cream AND not cleaning the coffee mug, as his “A’yi is on leave”;
                Fourth and
                Fifth messages requesting my permission to pass on my contact to Alice; Sixth, Seventh and Eight
                messages were
                “Dude, you there”; and Ninth and final message, which he sent at around quarter to one, said, “Wife
                kicking my
                ass, sending your details to Alice, sorry, and good luck buddy.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Sorry and good luck? What should I interpret from that one? Should I have not
                    accepted the
                    request from Alice?</em> With that stimulating thought going through my mind, we reached South
                Huangpi road.
                I got out of the train, swiped out of the metro and walked to Exit 3 of the station. There were a couple
                of
                third-generation Mobikes, with adjustable seats, but I was not sure if I can ride on East Jingling road.
                Instead, I started walking, on Middle Huaihai Road, towards the noodle store.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Since I was walking at a brisk pace, I didn’t look at the phone, even though I felt two
                or
                three vibrations indicating I’ve got messages. I didn’t want to go crash into some old Shanghainese
                uncle or
                auntie and become liable for their injuries. I also didn’t want to get injured myself as some of these
                old
                Shanghainese uncles and aunties are strong and energetic folks, capable of flash dances after eating
                copious
                amounts of braised pork and meat dumplings.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I soon reached this noodle place which was introduced to me by a friendly finance
                intern in my
                previous company, about seven years back or so. She had taken me there for a local dinner, which we had
                to
                follow up with some famous Shanghainese brand ice cream we bought from a nearby convenience store.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">On our way back home, she showed enough skin and dropped enough hints as to what she
                wanted.
                Even though she was fairly attractive and oozed sexiness in every step and word, I refused the offer, as
                I had a
                strict no dating or relationship at work policy. She left the company afterwards and had remained in
                contact for
                a year or so after that. We then drifted apart as our lives became busier and more complicated over
                time. That
                was over seven years back. As you can see, the noodle place came with a side dish of personal history
                too.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The lady at the counter recognised me and greeted me with the usual friendly banter
                about still
                being single and if I wanted she could introduce me to some beautiful girls. I think she doesn’t realise
                the
                fact that even if I have a girlfriend, I didn’t want to bring my girlfriend to a hard-to-find
                hole-in-the-wall
                noodle joint. It should have been obvious, but then “obvious” is dependent on the culture you are in.
                Perhaps
                for the Chinese, it’s normal to bring their girlfriend to this place, given that it was voted as one of
                the top
                ten lane house noodle joints. I guess, I still have a long way to go, in terms of learning the language
                and the
                culture.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In any case, I smiled and responded that I don’t have an apartment yet, nor a Shanghai
                licence
                plate so can’t find a suitable girlfriend. She nodded understandingly and asked me if I am going to eat
                the same
                thing – Peanut sauce noodles, fried steak and boiled lettuce? I told her that I had too much to drink
                last night
                so no fried steak and that I wanted half the noodles and extra peanut sauce. The bill came to around RMB
                20
                which I paid up in two tens. I picked up the chopsticks and napkins, give the stub to the server A’yi
                and told
                her that I will be sitting upstairs.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I walked up the steep stairs to the “second floor”, which was more like a mezzanine
                they had
                built to accommodate extra customers and was divided into two sections. There was only one guy in the
                first
                section and a girl in the second section. Nice, I can have a peaceful dinner, without being disturbed.
                The phone
                had vibrated a couple of times more, reminding me that I needed to see those messages. I got to grow a
                pair,
                stop imagining what Nicole might have said, and see those messages. I don’t need to overthink this; my
                intuition
                said that she needs a friend and that she wants nothing more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I chose a table that was the furthest from the girl. I dragged the table out so that I
                can slip
                into the inside seat. The table squeaked a bit and I could make out from the corner of my eye that the
                girl was
                looking up at me. I had this sense of déjà vu, something familiar about the girl, but I was so caught up
                in the
                thought of messages from Nicole and Alice that I didn’t give it any second thoughts.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365560">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 11. So Jaded…</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">“Is that you Anand? Oh my God! It is you! Why don’t to you join me?” exclaimed a
                familiar voice
                as I started taking off the jacket. I was a bit startled as I didn’t expect to meet anyone I knew here,
                especially at this time. I would know that voice anywhere. After all, she introduced me to this place
                seven
                years back.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade Lin. The sweet, attractive, and sexy intern who introduced me to this place and
                tried to
                seduce me with peanut noodles and Shanghainese ice cream. I swear I get aroused sometimes when I think
                of peanut
                noodles. She was there, waiting for her food order. She had aged well over the past seven years, she
                looked
                really good for someone who was around 30 or 31. Looks like Nicole and perhaps Alice’s messages will
                have to
                wait for some more time. She had slipped out her seat and thrown open her arms to give me a huge bear
                hug. I
                hugged her right back. She smelled like heaven, a heady mix of her natural scents, expensive perfumes
                and even
                more expensive body lotions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hi Jade”, I mumbled into the silky hair and cradling her head, “How are you? Long-time
                no
                see!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t know that we were still on hugging terms, but I was not complaining. I started
                counting “Mississippi’s” and decided I should let go after three to five “Mississippi’s”. I did
                genuinely miss
                her, and I wanted to reach out to her more than once, but I heard she had got married or engaged or
                something
                like that. Perhaps, I heard wrong. I lost count after five Mississippi’s. She finally let go after about
                fifteen
                seconds, way longer than expected. She had a huge smile on her face and her eyes were sparkling with
                joy. That
                cannot be made up, unless and until she was high.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am okay…. God! I missed you so much”, she said gazing into my eyes, and continued,
                “In fact,
                I was thinking, I wish I could meet you one of these days, and here you are! I was thinking of talking
                to
                Charlie Xie to get your number or WeChat. Forget that… Give me your number and WeChat right away. It
                looks like
                you changed your number. Let me give you my new number, I had changed my number about four years back.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was touched by her enthusiasm and… a bit aroused. <em>God! Have I become a
                    pervert?</em> I
                told her my number and asked her to give me a missed call. I could feel the phone vibrating. I unlocked
                my phone
                to save her number. I dismissed all the WeChat and WhatsApp notifications which were piling up now.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I missed you as well. My phone number is my WeChat. You can add me from the contacts
                directly”, I told her as I was saving her number. “In fact, I was thinking of you on my way here”, I
                added with
                a wink and cheeky smile. I put my phone back into Do Not Disturb mode, locked it and put it into my
                pocket.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand! You are so bad. I was so immature that time”, she exclaimed and punched me
                playfully on
                my shoulder. She had blushed to a deep red as she understood the context perfectly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She gave me another dazzling smile and hugged me again. It felt more purposeful than
                the first
                hug.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could feel my arousal increasing and I hoped that she wouldn’t notice. She did notice
                and
                didn’t seem to care, I could feel her pressing closer to me, ever so briefly, before letting me go. I am
                not
                sure why I did, what I did next but I did it. I bend down, raised her chin and gently kissed her on her
                left
                cheeks, as close to her lips as possible. A very friendly kiss indeed, a high-five kiss. I let her go
                and sat
                down at her table as if nothing had happened.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was ready for the noodles now.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She stood there blushing again at my sudden forwardness and after a couple of seconds,
                slipped
                back into the seat with a happy smile on her face. This would have been the weirdest thing that must
                have
                happened in this restaurant, and I was thankful that place was mostly empty.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Let’s finish the noodles quickly and get out of here. We can go to TGI Friday’s or
                Element
                Fresh next to the bund. If you are not doing anything that is… let us get a drink, and catch up”, she
                said as
                her order arrived. She had ordered peanut sauce noodles and boiled lettuce, as well. I confirmed with
                her that I
                had absolutely nothing planned for the evening but catching up on some writing I have been doing, which
                can
                wait.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As she was mixing her noodles, my noodles had arrived and I asked the A’yi there to get
                me some
                sesame oil or peanut oil. She got me some sesame oil. I added a tablespoon of sesame oil and mixed the
                peanut
                sauce into the noodles. I added a couple of spoonsful of the soup to loosen up the noodles and mixed the
                whole
                thing again. We started eating quietly while occasionally stealing glances at each other. It looked like
                she
                wanted to ask me something.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The noodles tasted awesome and I was hungry. This bowl of noodles was not going to last
                very
                long.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I don’t mean to be rude, but I got to ask… Are you seeing someone these days?” Jade
                asked me
                finally, as I finished off the last of the noodles and vegetables. She was barely half-way into her
                noodles.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nope”, I said shaking my head, “I am single now”. I thought it would be obvious that I
                am
                single, by the fact that I am eating peanut noodles at a hole in the wall restaurant on a Saturday
                night.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was not sure if I should ask her if she was single or not, but perhaps I should have
                asked
                her that question before boldly kissing her, even though it was a high-five kiss. We all know, there is
                nothing
                called a high-five kiss. I just made that up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am single too”, she said almost as if reading my mind. She hesitated a bit and
                added,
                “Actually, I am divorced, now”</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Why is she giving me this information?</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh… Okay… I am sorry about that”, I stammered. She didn’t seem too upset or broken up
                about
                it, so I added, “It seems we have a lot of catching up to do. Finish your noodles and let’s get out of
                this
                place”, I said playfully, trying to lighten up the mood. She ignored me and continued eating her noodles
                leisurely. If she was upset about me trying to play down her being divorced, she hid it with a faint
                smile.
                Perhaps she was feeling happy at that moment. I let my eyes discretely roam over her, and if she did
                notice it,
                she ignored it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade was short, around 5’2” – 5’3” tall, and had a curvaceous body, that was surely the
                envy of
                any average Chinese girl. Despite the curves, she looked healthy and fit. Her silky hair was kept long
                and it
                framed her round face with large pale brown, almost fawn coloured shiny eyes, her sharper than your
                average
                Chinese nose and full tiny pouting lips that begged to be kissed. Her chin was sharp and perfect. Again,
                way out
                of my league, but she was interested in me once upon a time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If I remembered correctly, she had a mixed-blood heritage; her father is Italian and
                her mother
                is half Han Chinese and half Hui Chinese. Her skin was pale cream coloured and I am sure it would feel
                like
                velvet or satin to touch. Although she was technically an Italian citizen, she had grown up in mostly
                China
                after her parents had separated. This happened when she was young and apparently, her father didn’t want
                the
                liability of a child. This is the other thing I remember from the first time we had a meal together,
                which was
                in the same place.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was done with her noodles and left about a third of it uneaten. This is why I
                always
                ordered less, they give too much noodles here and most people end up wasting the noodles. She dabbed
                clean the
                corners of her mouth with a nap, drank some hot tea to wash down the noodles and said, “Let’s go”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I couldn’t help but stare at her red lip, which seemed redder than when I met her. This
                time,
                she caught me staring at her, but she didn’t make a big deal of it and stared right back at me. I was
                caught in
                her gaze and her pale brown eyes held me captivated for a few seconds. I finally tore myself away from
                her
                hypnotic gaze and wiped clean my lips too. I drank some hot tea to wash down the last bits of peanut
                sauce and
                so that she doesn’t see me swallow the huge lump forming in my throat. I start chewing a piece of gum
                and got up
                to go. She got up with me, slipped on her jacket which looked like a Burberry and starts following me.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we climbed down the steps, I offer my hand to her for support, half expecting her
                not to
                take it. She took it, and I could feel her skin and it indeed felt like velvet. As our hands touched, a
                vivid
                image flashed in front of my eyes and I felt that stupid lump forming in my throat again. I quickly
                swallowed
                that lump in my throat, pushed out that image out of my mind as we stepped out of the restaurant and out
                on to
                the street. The lady at the front desk was super happy to see me with Jade and called out a typical
                Chinese
                restaurant wishes for leaving customers, the loose translation of which would be “Walk Slowly. Come back
                soon”.

        <section id="_Toc51365561">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 12. Sparks in Xintiandi</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">We got out of the restaurant and on to the street but were still holding hands. For
                some
                reason, it appeared that we had trouble letting go of each other’s hands. After a few seconds of staring
                into
                each other’s eyes, I let go of her tiny well-manicured hands.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Let’s take a taxi there”, she said, visibly swallowing the lump in her throat. She
                took out
                her phone and used to ride-hailing app Didi to hail a ride to go to Pudong. As she typed out the
                address, I
                caught a glance at the time, and it was nearly 10 PM. As she hit the confirm button, I took out my
                cigarettes,
                moved next to a smoking post and lit one.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She followed me, took out her packet of cigarettes, some kind of slims, drew one out
                and lit it
                using a stylish jet flame lighter. She started staring at the road and continued smoking placidly. As we
                stood
                there smoking our cigarettes, she inquired where I was living these days and I told her I lived closed
                to
                Century Park and she replied that she lived close to <em>DongChang</em> road.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A jingle played out confirming that her ride-hailing request has been accepted. She
                stopped
                staring at the road and started checking the details of the car coming to pick us up. She was still
                facing the
                general direction of the road.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t know what to say as we waited for the taxi. I suddenly remembered that we
                didn’t have
                to go all the way to the Bund, as we had the option of going to Element Fresh in Xintiandi.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Jade, why don’t we go to Element Fresh in Xintiandi instead of TGI Friday on the Bund?
                It much
                quieter there and I like the ambience better.” I said casually as I flicked the ash off the cigarette.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s not a bad idea, I am okay with either”, she said stumping out her cigarette.
                She
                thought for a minute and made up her mind “Let’s walk to Xintiandi and see if we can get a seat. Oh, let
                me
                cancel the ride”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We started walking along Middle Huaihai Road in the general direction of Xintiandi. As
                we
                walked, she cancelled the ride she had booked and I heard the sound of Alipay wallet as a fine was auto
                deducted
                from her account for cancelling the ride. I took a last drag of the cigarette before stumping it out.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">She put the phone in her bag and added “and, Xintiandi Element Fresh is open very late…
                I
                believe till two in the morning.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This again was one of those occasions where I didn’t have anything to say, so I said
                the only
                thing that came to my mind, “Okay, that’s great.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hated myself for not being fast-talking or glib, for not being able to come up with a
                smarter
                response than ‘okay, that’s great’, but that’s who I was... Someone who gets dumbfounded at the simplest
                of the
                things. There were many possible responses to that comment now that I had ten seconds to think about it.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were so many things I wanted to ask her, starting with what she had been doing
                for the
                past few years, but I decided that it’s better to wait until we were seated in the cosy confines of
                Element
                Fresh.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, hey, Anand… Where did you go? You seemed lost for a moment there”, Jade said
                pulling at
                the sleeve of my jacket. I had zoned out thinking about what the appropriate response should have been.
                She was
                staring at me expectantly and I knew that I had to come up with a response to her question. <em>God, why
                    do I
                    put myself into situations like this?</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">We had reached the over-bridge and we had started climbing the stairs, which was
                steeper than I
                remembered from before. I climbed them two at a time to keep up with Jade, who was fairly nimble. I
                decided that
                honesty is the best policy in this case.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Uh… It’s just that I feel that sometimes my communication skills suck… Big time” said
                I
                panting slightly from the exertion of climbing stairs and talking at the same time. I took a deep breath
                as we
                reached the first landing and continued, “I mean, I could have said something better than ‘okay, that’s
                great’
                to your last comment. You must think that I am retarded.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She laughed at this comment, “Anand, you always think too much. Trust me, I never
                thought you
                are retarded. You don’t have to make up things to just for the sake of it”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She paused for a moment to think and added, “Agreed, you are not glib, but that’s what
                makes
                you, you… Thoughtful, caring and honest… Too thoughtful sometimes. At least this is what I think I know
                of you.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yeah well, too honest sometimes for my own good”, said I blushing at her comment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Better than being a lying, manipulative son… scum”, she said with an unexpected
                vehemence and
                checking herself at the very last moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There was no comeback for that, so I took her advice and kept quiet. We crossed the
                over-bridge
                and as we walked down the stairs, Jade held my left arm so that she wouldn’t lose her balance. Her hands
                were
                cold and I wanted to cup them between my arms and protect them, but I didn’t want to take any more
                excess
                liberty with her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we crossed Danshui road, I discarded the gum in a trash can we passed by and lit
                another
                cigarette. She quietly took the cigarette from my hand and without any hesitation started smoking it.
                The way
                she smoked that cigarette, I knew that I was not going to get it back, so I lit another cigarette and
                started
                smoking. I was not sure as to why she wanted to smoke my cigarette and not her own. If she wanted to try
                my
                cigarette brand, she could have just asked or was she so lost in thought that she didn’t realise what
                she was
                doing. Maybe she was just being lazy. I also wondered if it was some sort of signal of intimacy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Stop overthinking this</em>, I told myself to quieten all these random,
                unproductive
                thoughts, but it would be great to know what was going through her mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We reached Element Fresh at Xintiandi and we had to wait for about ten minutes before
                getting a
                table. We quietly smoked another cigarette. This time I lit two of mine and handed over one to Jade,
                which she
                accepted with a grateful smile. Her eyes sparkled brightly as she watched me smoke. After a few moments,
                she
                looked away and started watching people walking around. A lot of people were passing by, either going to
                get a
                drink or coming out on one of the pubs lining the street and most of them openly stared at Jade and
                completely
                ignored me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She looked like some artist’s work had come to life, and it was difficult not to stare
                at her.
                I remained invisible to most people around me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When it was time to be seated, we both decided that it’s better to sit inside as it was
                getting
                colder outside and we had smoked enough for the time being. I know, if we were seated outside, we will
                be
                tempted to smoke more and Jade must have agreed with me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I held open the door for Jade. As she passed by me, I caught a whiff of perfume she was
                wearing
                and felt dizzy again. I quickly followed her to our table. Jade removed her jacket, as I pulled out the
                chair
                for her. She draped the jacket on the chair and moved in to sit down. I caught another whiff of her
                scent and
                nearly blacked out.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Grow up, man! Stop acting like a teenager,</em> I admonished myself. As she sat
                down I
                leaned in a hair closer than what was needed and I caught the scent of her breath, and I started feeling
                aroused
                again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gathered myself quickly, remove my jacket, draped over the chair across from her and
                sat
                down. There was a strange expression on her face, which was flushed and her lips were ruby red now. Her
                irises
                were dilated and her breath sounded shallow. If I didn’t know any better, she was either aroused or
                feeling
                cold. I went with ‘feeling cold’, although I was not aware of any science that supported that theory.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>She MUST be feeling cold</em>, I convinced myself… I tended to sell myself very
                shortly,
                and I like to play it very safe.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I cleared my throat and called for the menu. The waiter materialised five seconds
                later, with
                two each of the food and drinks menus, which was unnecessary as I always ordered gin martini, Bombay
                Sapphire
                version with olives. He glanced at both of us, smiled at me and with a flourish, lit the candle on the
                table.
                Perhaps he could read the current situation better than I could myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“This is unnecessary,” Jade said, after taking a sip of water, “I know what I want. I
                usually
                drink Viña Casablanca, Merlot.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“And, what about you sir?” the waiter asked in fairly decent English. I know it sounds
                funny
                when an Indian act as the judge for English standards, but then this is China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I will take a Gin Martini, shaken, Bombay Sapphire version with olives”, I said
                closing the
                menu and placing it on the table. I added with a smile, looking Jade into her eyes, “I too know what I
                want.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade found this funny and perhaps caught the underlying meaning, as I could see that
                her blush
                was back.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“We will not be needing the food menu”, she said to the waiter who removed the menus
                and
                disappeared quietly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We fell silent again. I was not sure why she was silent, but I was quiet because I was
                not sure
                where to start. I was also terrified of saying something stupid. The place was filled with people –
                friends,
                couples, families – who all had something to talk. I was feeling the non-existent peer pressure. I
                decided I can
                perhaps start with something innocent like what she’s been doing for the past seven years.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“For a guy who knows what he wants, you sure do pretend a lot”, she said breaking the
                silence
                before I could. She said this with a naughty spark in her eyes and lopsided smile.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If I don’t pretend, I might say or do things that you may not like or you may not find
                acceptable, like when I kissed you tonight”, I responded defensively, immediately regretting saying
                those words.
                “Listen, I didn’t mean any disrespect when I did that, I was just so pleased to see you after such a
                long time”,
                I quickly clarified. In my mind, I just made things worse and pictured her stomping out of here, with me
                chasing
                after her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She didn’t seem insulted, instead, she seemed genuinely pleased. Our drinks
                materialised by our
                side and the waiter disappeared after a polite nod of his head.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s the thing Anand, I am not insulted,” she said while twirling her glass of
                merlot. I
                stirred the martini with the olives, waiting for her to complete her thoughts, but I felt she might
                follow it up
                with a ‘but’ clause. So, imagine my surprise when she tells me, “On the contrary, I am happy to see you
                too and
                I like the fact that you were so happy to see me too.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She took a sip of the wine and purred in appreciation. Her lips looked even redder and
                her eyes
                were shining like diamonds. She gently licked her lips, and it looked deliberate to me. So, knowing very
                well
                that she will be looking to gauge my reaction, I pretended as if I was captivated by the olives in my
                martini
                instead of staring at her. I was also trying very hard to calm down my arousal. I took a sip of my
                martini and
                felt the crispy martini warm up my body. I sighed in satisfaction and sipped the martini again and ate
                half an
                olive. I loved the bitter-sweet taste of olives, especially in a gin martini. For a few seconds, I was
                oblivious
                to everything around me, but her voice brought me back.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, tell me, Anand, how you been? What you been up to, all these years?” she asked,
                “The last
                time we talked was six years back or so.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh, you know… just living my life one day at a time. I work at a different company
                now”, I
                said after clearing my throat. It appeared that Jade was waiting for me to continue so I continued my
                ramble.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay so… I was getting tired of working all the time, so I decided that I should take
                a break.
                This was about four years back. My contract was sent to expire in about five months and I had to option
                to
                continue. You know how much my boss ‘loved me’”, I said emphasising ‘loved me’ with an air quote.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh Yeah, I remember how much… whats-his-name ‘loved you’”, she said, air quoting
                ‘loved you’.
                She was giggling hard, I think, trying to remember the name of my boss.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, Mr Ravi Kumar”, I said laughing, “Yes, he ‘loved’ me a lot, so much that he would
                call me
                on weekend and give me ‘urgent’ tasks to finish”, I said air quoting ‘loved’ and ‘urgent’.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both shared a laugh at the fond memory of a demanding, taskmaster of a boss, who
                cared a lot
                about the wellbeing of his people.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I always wanted to do my MBA, but I wanted to ensure that I had the bird in my hand… I
                mean at
                least one admit in my hand. I didn’t want to renew the contract, then put in the paper and let down
                Kumar”, I
                continued as soon as we had recovered.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh my God, you were worried about Kumar’s feeling; how sensitive of you!” Jade said
                with a
                laugh and a wink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay, very funny… In any case, I had three months to get a decent score in GMAT and
                finish my
                applications. I was targeting CEIBS and HKUST since I have been living in China for four years already
                and it
                made sense to me”, I didn’t know why I disclosed that information as it didn’t seem relevant. Strangely
                enough,
                Jade was captivated by my boring narrative. I was not sure if I should disclose the fact that I was
                dating a
                Chinese girl some months back, and I was sort of serious about her. I discovered very painfully that she
                was not
                as serious about the relationship as I was. Another sip of the martini helped me decide that I better
                not
                disclose the details of that relationship, as that was one burnt bridge I was not proud of.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I registered to take GMAT two months down the line and for the next seven weeks, I
                woke up at
                4 AM every day, studied for the test. I used every available free time, including my lunch hour
                preparing my MBA
                applications, studying for the test and convincing my managers, including Kumar, to give me sparkling
                recommendations” I continued and Jade seemed to be hanging on to every word I spoke. Her smile and a
                slight nod
                of her head motivated me to continue, with my story. I noticed that her wine glass was empty, so I
                signalled to
                the waiter, who magically reappeared next to us, to get her another glass of wine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When her wine arrived, she took another sip of the wine and I followed her suit. I took
                another
                sip of the martini I have been ignoring for so long, ate an olive and continued with my story.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“All the effort paid off as I managed to get a decent, above-average GMAT score. That
                combined
                with my work experience and the recommendations, got me into CEIBS, but not into HKUST. This was okay
                for me as
                I thought I had my life figured out, and CEIBS was closer to home for me”, I shouldn’t have disclosed
                the last
                part as I could see her eyebrow going up, in slow motion.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Closer to home?” she asked questioningly, took another sip of the wine and licking her
                lips
                deliberately.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hate it when I dig my hole and keep falling into it. There was no way out of this
                one, so I
                finished my martini in a gulp, ate the remaining olive, and ordered another martini before I continued
                with my
                story. I asked for extra olives this time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Listen, if it is something you don’t want to talk about or something you are not proud
                of, you
                can skip over it, but you can talk to me and I am not going to judge you”, she said as we waited for my
                martini
                with extra olives to be served.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“No, it’s fine. I just don’t talk about it anymore”, I said lying to myself as much as
                I was
                lying to her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My martini with the extra olives materialised in front of me about ten seconds later…
                ten
                seconds that we spend staring into each other’s souls. I was trying to figure out how much I can trust
                her with.
                There was something in her eyes that I couldn’t place, but then my emotional quotient was fairly low and
                whatever remaining emotional quotient I have, nosedives after a couple of stiff drinks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I need some liquid courage before I could continue with the story. I ate two olives and
                took a
                large gulp of the martini finishing about one-third of the drink in the process. Jade took a large sip
                of the
                wine that nearly finished half her drink. I did what any gentleman would do and ordered a bottle of the
                merlot
                and I asked for an extra glass so that we can share the bottle. To hell with not mixing drinks. I felt
                this was
                the right thing to do when there is going to be digressions in the story. The waiter refilled Jade’s
                glass and
                poured me a glass as well. I ignored the wine for the time being.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I was in a serious relationship at that time, which I thought meant something and I
                wanted to
                stay in Shanghai for that person. I am not saying there is anything wrong with CEIBS, but if I was not
                in a
                relationship, I would have probably been more serious about HKUST and would have applied to other
                universities
                as well. She left me halfway into my MBA, as she wanted to, in her own words, think of her future, and
                she was
                not convinced I could give her a future that she wanted, as I am an Indian. Anyway, that’s all in the
                past.” I
                concluded keeping all emotions out of my voice. But, if I am honest with myself, it hurts a lot – having
                failed
                so miserably a second time in a relationship and having to talk about it. What hurts me the most was the
                fact
                that my ex-girlfriend told me she’s leaving me because I am an Indian.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could see a mix of pity, empathy and sympathy in her eyes as I told her this. I hated
                it when
                people took pity on my past. I took another large sip of the martini and paused to bring my seething
                emotions
                under control.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, I am sorry that you have to relive your past but trust me when I tell you this
                – you
                are better off single than with a person who cannot accept you for who you are – Indian and all”, she
                said, in
                an attempt to pacify me. She took another large sip of the wine and waited for me to continue.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finished the martini and the olives before continuing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Please… It’s alright. I am okay to share this now”, I said, swallowing the big lump of
                emotions forming in my throat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It looks like everything worked out okay… It seems like you are better off now”, said
                she
                taking a large sip of the wine. If I didn’t know better, she was trying to get drunk and get me drunk as
                well.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yup, you are right. The break up motivated me to study and work my ass off. I also
                managed to
                land my current job”, I said nodding my head and pouring a large drink of wine. I also topped up her
                wine glass
                and she nodded her head in appreciation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, all is well that ends well… I think you are doing better. You look better than
                ever”, said
                with a hint of a smile on her face. She was twirling her wine glass and her eyes were bright. She seemed
                to be
                challenging me. My head was swimming from the martini, wine and all those pheromones. I was aroused,
                physically
                and mentally. I told myself that I was imagining things and the drinks must have got to me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, indeed”, I said clearing my throat, “So tell me what you been up to?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hmm… where do I start?” she pondered taking a large sip. Her speech was slurring a bit
                from
                all the wine. I decided to pace myself and took a small sip of the red wine and savoured the flavour and
                texture
                of the wine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Tell me, what do you do now?”, I asked her trying to get her to talk. I intentionally
                avoided
                the subject of divorce.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I work for an Italian conglomerate as a finance controller. I am in charge of the Asia
                Pacific
                business unit”, she said, sounding bored, “but, I am serving my notice period now. My estranged father
                left me a
                fortune and his estate, so I plan to take a break and take care of some unfinished family business. I
                would like
                to do nothing for some time and catch up on my life. I was so busy with the work that I had a fairly
                successful
                career, but mostly nothing else.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She paused to take another generous sip of the wine. She licked her ruby red lips and
                contemplated as to what to say next.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That sounds amazing. I wish I can do that. I envy you”, I said abruptly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Haha, maybe you should do it”, she said with a laugh and wink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I laughed at that thought. If I had a bunch of cash or inheritance, I would use that
                money to
                travel the world and experience different cultures. I would love to try different kinds of foods and
                wines from
                these places. It will be good to have Jade with me, and we can travel and Airbnb all over Europe. I
                would make
                love to her every night. It would be amazing…</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand”, she called snapping me out my little muse, “where did you go again?” she asked
                me
                while twirling the wine glass.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I was just fantasising… imagining”, I said, quickly correcting myself – I don’t want
                to use
                words that convey my true feelings. I continued, “I was imagining what I will do if I had a bunch of
                money. I
                will probably take a road trip around Europe, stay Airbnb and try different cuisines from around
                Europe.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s a good plan, we should do it”, said Jade taking another large sip of the wine.
                I topped
                up her glass and pretended to ignore her ‘we should do it’ comment. She was getting drunk and was surely
                not in
                control of her thoughts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I mean it, Anand, we should do it. Don’t think I am saying this because I am slightly
                drunk. I
                know Europe pretty well and I can be your guide, except when it comes to Italy”, she continued, sounding
                somewhat in control but not entirely there.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay, sounds like a plan, I will think about it”, I said trying to conclude the
                subject. Now
                that I was getting drunk, I wanted to know more about the divorce, but I didn’t want to reopen any
                wounds.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She nodded her head in satisfaction and started swirling the glass. She took a large
                sip of the
                wine and unsteadily placed the glass on a fork. The glass tipped over and I managed to grab the glass
                before the
                wine spilt all over the table. Jade mouth was open in shock and embarrassment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Listen, I think we both had enough wine”, I said moving her wine glass away from her
                and
                pushing away my wine glass. This time I could read the embarrassment and shame on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry Anand, I drank too much and drank too fast. I think I need a cup of coffee,
                maybe a
                latte”, she said blushing a bit. She pushed the wine glass further away from her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s okay Jade, we have all been there before”, I said reassuringly. She looked
                fragile and
                vulnerable and I wanted to do nothing but hold her and reassure her that everything is okay.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I waved to catch the eye of the waiter, who was on the computer doing something. When
                he
                materialised by our sides, I ordered two cups of latte with extra shots of espresso. I knew that the
                Italian in
                Jade would appreciate the extra espresso shot. She smiled and nodded her head in confirmation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Thank you, Anand. How did you know that I take my latte with an extra shot of
                espresso?” she
                inquired.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I didn’t know. I just ordered for you, what I usually order for myself”, I said with a
                slight
                shrug of shoulder and tilt of the head.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade smiled and excused herself to go to the bathroom. She was a little drunk and a bit
                wobbly,
                but other than that seemed okay. She walked confidently to the ladies’ room. I knew for sure, she was
                okay as
                she didn’t stagger into the men’s room and she gracefully avoided a drunk gentleman, who sort of
                stumbled out of
                the bathroom and missed the step.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was nearly midnight, and I was slightly tipsy. I wanted to get out of here and get a
                fresh
                breath of air. I called for the billed and paid the bill using WeChat. There was over a quarter of the
                wine left
                in the bottle. I had half a glass full of the wine as well. Jade’s glass was just over half full as
                well. I
                could see the outline of her lipstick on the rim of the glass. For some weird reason, I started thinking
                about
                her lip and started imagining how it would feel to kiss them. The waiter came back and served us the
                coffee with
                little chocolate cookies on the side. I snapped out my reverie and nodded politely at the waiter.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade was taking her time, and I was done twiddling fingers. I reached for my wine glass
                and
                finished the wine in a couple of large sips. I stirred the coffee breaking the foam art pattern. I blew
                the
                steam and took a tentative sip of the coffee. It was scalding hot, so I set it back on the table and
                waited for
                it to cool down a bit. I was tempted to reach for my phone and read all the messages that were piled up
                by now.
                I didn’t want to start now because I knew I can’t resist replying to messages and I didn’t want to be
                distracted
                around Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Thankfully, Jade came back to the table, sat down and took a large sip of the wine
                nearly
                finishing the glass. I guess she forgot about drinking too much and too fast. I didn’t say anything,
                because she
                looked like she needed a drink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry… I know, I should not be drinking so much, but just got a horrible message from
                the
                ex-husband. I don’t know how he got my number” she said with some passion and finished her wine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hmm… I am sorry to hear that. Do you… maybe want to talk about it?” I asked her
                tentatively as
                I pushed the coffee cup towards her. Jade shook her head and that was that.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I took a sip of the coffee and took a bite of the chocolate cookie. Jade followed my
                cue and
                took a large sip of the coffee and sighed in satisfaction. She licked off the foam that was stuck on her
                upper
                lips, an action I found immensely erotic. Right now, even if she blew her nose loudly, I would have
                found it
                erotic. We enjoyed the coffee in silence. We didn’t have to say anything and apparently, we both were
                okay with
                that. I finished my coffee over the next ten minutes or so and Jade soon finished the coffee soon after.
                We both
                ignored the remaining wine. She didn’t touch the chocolate cookie; she was perhaps watching her figure.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Do you want to leave now? I could use a walk”, she asked as she wiped her lips with
                the linen.
                She took a sip of the water and waited for my response.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sure, that sounds good,” I said. “By the way, I paid the bill”, I added, as I could
                see she
                was taking out her credit card and about to call for the bill.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey, that’s not fair! I invited you”, she said pretending to be upset, but I could see
                that
                she was pleased that I was being a gentleman.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s okay, if you are so upset, you can pay next time we meet”, I told her tongue in
                cheek.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">She got up laughing and put on her jacket. I did the same and indicated with a nod of
                my head
                that I am ready to leave. The waiter who served us that night helped to open the door and thanked us for
                our
                patronage. I slipped a 100 <em>renminbi</em> note into his hand and thanked him for his service. Tipping
                might
                not be a custom in China and but as a foreigner, there are some liberties that I am allowed. Plus the
                guy looked
                like he was from the Philippines.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We got out on to the pedestrian street in Xintiandi and turned right to take a walk. It
                was
                nearly half-past noon but the place was still well lit and had a fair amount of people loitering around.
                The
                German bar next to the Element Fresh had some live performance going on and people were streaming in and
                out of
                the bar. Jade linked her arms with mine and leaned against my shoulder as we walked towards the end of
                the
                street. I read that as a friendly gesture and tried not to think too much about it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I wanted to ask you about the divorce, but then I don’t want to reopen any wounds”, I
                said as
                we walked aimlessly. She looked at me for a few moments trying to size me up and probably trying to
                understand
                my motive. She must have been convinced as she took a deep breath and started her narration.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Well, you shared your story, so it’s only fair that I do the same. This happened a
                year after
                I left the company we were working for. I was young and my idea of a relationship was very different at
                that
                time. I wanted to marry a rich, handsome guy who had many apartments in Shanghai. I found such a guy and
                fought
                my way to his attention. Me being half Italian sort of helped… initially. I was a curiosity that
                attracted many
                suitors and my future husband was a competitive type who wanted to win my attention one way or the
                other.
                Finally, he did win or I let him win. After all, luxury gifts and expensive restaurants were a sure sign
                that
                the guy was a good catch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“We got married six months into the relationship. He was good to me for all of three
                months
                after which he started cheating on me and started seeing his ex-girlfriends, who just wanted to get back
                with
                him even though he was a married man. This is one of the hard realities of being a rich man – Some women
                are
                desperate to find a rich partner or a sugar daddy and will do anything to win the attention of that man.
                I tried
                hard to get him back but he was already bored of me and his curiosity for a mixed-blood Chinese was
                sated. At
                this point, he wanted to be with me only for my passport and nothing else”, she paused as we waited to
                cross the
                street.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As she was speaking we crossed over to the other half of Xintiandi and walked towards
                the mall
                at the end of the pedestrian street. I could hear jazz music floating into the street from the bar grill
                located
                on the left side of the street. There were few couples taking photos in front of some temporary art
                structure in
                the square by the mall. There was also a group of young foreigners celebrating someone’s birthday.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Long story short, just a year into the marriage, I had no option but to file for a
                divorce. I
                didn’t want to be with a person who treated me like an object and who was using me to get a passport. I
                had
                learnt my lesson; I got what I wanted – A rich, handsome husband, but that came at a great price. It
                took me
                nearly two years of fighting and suing to get back my freedom”, Jade concluded with a heavy sigh that
                indicated
                the true extent of the relief she felt.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stood in front of the art structure which was shaped like a large monkey, indicating
                the
                arrival of the year of the monkey. It was about thirty feet tall and was mostly red. I found it
                fascinating as
                it appeared to be made with large Lego blocks. As it was lit from inside, the surrounding area was
                washed in a
                reddish light.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I turned to look at Jade and saw that she was washed in the light from the sculpture
                and had
                turned a monochromatic red. She seemed to be admiring the sculpture. Her eyes were glistening and she
                stood rapt
                in attention. I could see the fine mist of her breath coming out through her parted lips. She looked
                incredible…
                ethereal even, and I couldn’t tear my eyes off her. I was feeling tipsy now as the crisp air sort of
                enhanced
                the high from martini and wine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What? Is there something wrong?” she said as she turned to face me and caught me
                staring at
                her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh… Uh… No, there is nothing wrong”, I stammered as I was brought back to reality. “I
                think
                you look different in this light”, I continued, pointing at the sculpture.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh, ‘good different’ or ‘bad different’?” she asked looking directly into my eyes. I
                could see
                that her eyes, which are naturally pale brown, were so dilated that it looked black. Was it an
                attraction or
                just low light? I went with the option of low light.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s a ‘very good different’. You look… angelic. Beautiful in a different kind of
                way”, I
                replied emboldened by my partially drunk state.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She blushed visibly at that comment and even though she was washed in the light from
                the
                sculpture and I could see her blush. I was not sure if it was because she was angry or because she was
                feeling
                abashed at the comment or because she was probably drunk. I decided to play it safe.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Again, I don’t mean any disrespect; I am honest when I am drunk”, I said with an
                embarrassed
                smile.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, it's fine…”, she said, and added bashfully, “I like it when you are honest with
                me.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Was that a hint that I got from Jade? For some reason, my subconscious couldn’t reject
                that
                idea. I somehow knew that moment that Jade felt some sort of attraction for me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stood there for some more time, arms liked and unaware of the time passing. Jade
                drew closer
                to me until we were standing shoulder to shoulder. I didn’t care about the time and I didn’t care who
                was around
                us; I was feeling content.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We finally started walking back after about five or ten minutes. We didn’t have to talk
                and
                felt mentally connected, at least that what I felt then. We walked hand in hand till we reached the
                beginning of
                the Xintiandi pedestrian street and joined the long queue for a taxi at the intersection of
                <em>Taicang</em>
                Road and <em>Madang</em> Road. As we waited, it seemed that it was difficult for us to let go of each
                other.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“This queue is too long, let me try to hail a cab using Didi”, she said abruptly. I let
                go of
                her hand and she did the same. She took out her cell phone and tapped out her home address. She got a
                ride in
                the next minute or so. This might sound a bit chauvinistic, but I have found that good looking women
                always
                could hail a ride easily in Shanghai.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was about to try my luck hailing a ride when Jade stopped me and told me, “Listen,
                you can
                take the same car since we are heading in the same direction. I can tell the driver to drop you home
                after he
                drops me home.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay, that sounds good, but you will have to let me pay for the ride”, I said trying
                to sound
                chivalrous.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Not going to happen, you got the drinks… This is the least I can do”, Jade replied
                firmly, and
                with a hint of a smile on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I accepted the offer with a shrug and polite nod of the head.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 13. The Tango</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">As we waited, I lit two cigarettes and offered one to her. We stood there smoking our
                cigarettes in silence. I was very much lost in my thoughts. I was not a big believer of God or fate or
                destiny
                or any of those things, but somehow, it felt that my life in the past two days was playing catch up for
                all that
                it had missed. Maybe there is a God after all or some sort of higher power who realised that I was not
                getting
                my fair share of friendship and relationships. How else can I explain meeting someone like Nicole in the
                most
                unbelievable way possible and she trusting me enough to let me into her house?! How else can I explain
                reconnecting with Jade in the most improbable place possible?! How else can I explain all this happening
                in less
                than two days?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">An atheist would perhaps use some sort of advanced statistics and probability to prove
                that it
                is possible that this sort of thing will happen once in a million year to guy like me and the guy just
                happened
                to be me… Or for an agnostic person like me, this might be proof that there is God.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was optimistic that, I have at the very least a fabulous friend, in Nicole. I was
                fairly sure
                that I will have something more with Jade, though I was not sure how to proceed from here. This is how
                things
                happened in my life, the beginning is good and I get the ball rolling, but sometimes the ball hits a
                valley and
                loses its momentum. There were far too many occasions where I would have a lot to talk, but finally
                reach a
                point whereby the third date, I have nothing to say.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I took a long puff of the cigarette and turned to admire Jade again when I realised
                that she
                was talking to me or more accurately, was trying to talk to me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry? What did you just say? I was not listening”, I stammered in an apologetic
                voice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I was saying that” she repeated, a bit abashedly, and her words slurring a bit,
                “…that, I too,
                think of you whenever I eat peanut noodles”. She turned away from me trying to hide her blushing face
                and
                continued smoking.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could feel my heart skip a beat. I was sure that time stopped as well. Everything was
                frozen
                for a couple of seconds. I dropped my half-finished cigarette and moved closer to Jade. I turned her
                around by
                her shoulder, looked into her beautiful eyes and told her, “Jade, I am going to kiss you now”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I half-expected a slap.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One moment, her eyes were wide with surprise, next moment she drew close to me with a
                smile on
                her face. She dropped her half-finished cigarette, looped her hands around my neck, and with surprising
                strength
                pulled my face down until our lips were hardly a centimetre apart.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What the hell took you so long?” she whispered half playfully, half-seriously, and a
                bit
                drunk. I could smell the wine and passion in her breath. I understood what she meant; counting from the
                day we
                meet, it took us over seven years to do what we wanted to do.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I needed no further invitation and I kissed her. Whatever guilt I had about kissed her
                when she
                was drunk, evaporated the moment my lips touched her lips. She responded to the kiss and our bodies were
                melded
                together in a heady symphony. We kissed fiercely and hungrily – A hunger that has been pent up in both
                of us for
                seven years and hunger that survived all the relationships and flings in between. Our lips were entwined
                passionately trying to satiate that hunger. The whole world around us along with 24 odd million people
                in
                Shanghai had ceased to exist for us – we were in our little parallel universe, where we were together
                and we
                were happy. Nothing in the world could break this moment, nothing but the call from the car driver who
                accepted
                Jade’s ride. Damn! I wish she had put her phone on Do Not Disturb mode.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We broke the kiss hesitantly and stood there looking at each other, a bit dazed, but
                basking in
                the heady glow of hormones and pheromones rushing through our body and dizzying our senses. We were like
                two
                magnets kept apart by force; we wanted to touch each other, taste each other, and consume each other in
                every
                possible way imaginable. I certainly had a wild imagination, but the first thought was –<em> I want to
                    take her
                    home and make love her</em>.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She answered the call and told the driver where we were waiting.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Let’s go to my place and uh… get some coffee there”, she said hesitantly, with a
                slight blush
                on her face. Before I could protest, she added, “I am not asking you because I am drunk and senseless. I
                am
                asking you this because I want… this. I want to spend more time with you and you will not be taking
                advantage of
                a drunk girl.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hugged her again and gave her a gentle kiss. I could feel her passion by the way she
                was
                holding on to me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gently let her go and felt her hesitation in breaking the hug. I lit a couple of
                cigarettes
                and offered her one. She accepted it and started smoking with a look of satisfaction on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The car arrived about a couple of minutes later and we stubbed out the cigarette,
                before
                getting into the car. I opened the door for her and watched her slide into the car gracefully. I got in
                beside
                her, and sit next to her, shoulder to shoulder, and cupped her cold right hand in my hands to warm them
                up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oooh… your hands are nice and warm,” she cooed, as she cuddled closer to me. For some
                weird
                reason, however cold it was outside, my hands always remain warm. It was weird because I am South Indian
                who
                grew up in hot South India and my body was technically supposed to be sensitive to cold.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Either the driver was in a hurry or sensed we were in a hurry. Whatever was the case,
                the
                driver drove like the devil and got us to her place in less than fifteen minutes. We didn’t talk for the
                whole
                duration and did nothing but hold hands and feel each other’s presence. She leaned again me and again I
                could
                smell her perfume and it was intoxicating. The silence was heavenly and the air heavy with promises.
                Sometimes,
                you don’t need words to express yourself. A gentle touch or a smile suffices.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We got out of the car and on the street-facing her apartment. Another jingle from her
                phone
                confirmed that the payment was deducted automatically from her account. She flicked the little button on
                the
                side of her phone to silence it and put the phone on Do Not Disturb mode.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She lived in the DongChang road area, and the apartment she lived in, was a walk-up
                apartment;
                one from before that area boomed and became one of the most expensive real estates in Shanghai. I follow
                her to
                her apartment building. She entered her six-digit passcode to unlock the main door; I turned away, to
                give her
                privacy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s your birthday”, I heard her say.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What?” I asked a bit confused. My birthday was quite some time back at that moment, my
                brain
                was not computing well.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I mean the passcode has been your birthday since my mother and grandparents gave me
                this
                apartment around five years back”, she repeated with a smile.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This hit me on many levels; it appears that I had mistaken Jade’s forwardness, way back
                then.
                She perhaps was interested in me as a person as well. It was clear that she was interested in a physical
                relationship, but maybe, she expected a bit more than just mindless sex. It would also appear that she
                held me
                in a special place in her heart, which sort of affected me. Don’t get me wrong, I still wanted to sleep
                with
                her, but I decided that I will do my best to be respectful. The assumption here, of course, was that all
                this
                will lead to sex, sometime soon.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we walked up the stairs, I took out my cell phone, made a note of her address. I
                will send
                her a big bunch of flowers some other time. We reached her apartment, which was on the fourth floor.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Are you okay?” She asked me, as she opened her apartment door with a traditional key.
                It was
                clear that a bit concerned with my silence.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am okay. Jade, I was wrong to judge you back then.” I admitted to her, as we stepped
                into
                her apartment. I knew very well that she might ask me to leave. Before she could say anything more, “I
                am very
                sorry for that. I just realised how much I like you and perhaps…” I hesitated a bit but decided to say
                it anyway
                “…how much you like me, how much you think of me and how you think of me.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The last sentence came out weird and was completely out of place. Even to my ears, it
                sounded a
                bit narcissistic. Talk about bad timing. Her eyes widened a bit in surprise and smiled at what I blurted
                out.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s okay. To be honest, I was immature, superficial and shallow at that time. It took
                a
                painful marriage for me to become a somewhat normal person”, she said, apparently lost in some painful
                memory.
                She closed the door behind us, turned on the light and heater and added: “I have always liked you for
                the person
                you are.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stared at each other at this admission. I had forgotten about Alice completely and
                Nicole
                was just a faint but persistent memory. The silence was tangible, and we could hear each other’s heavy
                breaths.
                I could feel the slight hum of the heater as the apartment warmed up slowly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“May I have something to drink please?” I said breaking the silence. I know it's rude
                to ask
                for a drink at someone else’s place, but I sounded much better than my real thought was, <em>I want to
                    make love
                    to you all night</em>.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh… okay. I am sorry, I was thinking of something else” she said breaking the eye
                contact. She
                walked into her kitchen as I waited in her living room. It was a large living room which was similar to
                my
                living room in design except larger and had wine cabinet with a collection of wines. I recognised Yellow
                Tail,
                and Jacob’s Creek, as these were the only wines I bought. If you don’t know anything about wine, buy
                Yellow Tail
                or Jacob’s Creek. Coming back to her living room, it also opened out to a covered balcony and I could
                make out
                an easel and a partially completed painting. This is another discovery for me – that she’s interested in
                art. I
                should plan a visit to one of those art streets in Shanghai with Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I waited for her, I took off my bag and placed it near one the sofa.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade has returned with two wine glasses. She placed it on the living rooming coffee
                table. She
                took off her jacket and placed, in a closet next to the entrance of the apartment. I followed her and
                took off
                my jacket and handed it to her. I was standing close to her and I could smell her perfume. She could
                feel me
                standing behind her, she kept the jacket in the closet and she turned to face me. I could see that she
                was
                breathing heavily, and her whole body was shaking with passion.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I pulled her to me and bend down to kiss her. She tip-toed to close the gap and we
                kissed
                again, but this time gently and passionately, as if we had all the time in the world and as if we needed
                to
                savour this moment. She tasted headier than the headiest wine I had in my life. I could feel a bit of
                giddiness
                as blood rushed into my extremities. Her moaning against my lips was not helping this moment. My thirst
                was all
                but forgotten.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I want to make love to you”, I said, voicing my real thoughts, “all night, if
                possible.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, make love to me”, she said, her voice hoarse with passion. Her lips were a deep
                red now
                and very inviting. I wanted to kiss her again, but the rational me, who was fast dying in the face of
                the
                possibility of sex with a very attractive person, had to ask the question.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Are we moving too fast?” I ask her in a whisper, my lips brushing against her.
                Rational me was
                hanging on by a thread, <em>Die, you rational bastard, Die!</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What? Don’t fuck with me now. I waited a long time for this… seven years if we count
                the time
                we went for that dinner!” she exclaimed, very seriously, grabbed me and started kissing me hungrily
                again. With
                that, the ‘rational me’ went into a coma. She started dragging me to her bedroom, mumbling, “I hope you
                are
                carrying protection”. I managed to grab my bag, as I always had extra condoms in my bag’s media pocket,
                other
                than that I have two in my wallet. When I said “all night long”, I meant “all night long”, I have been
                preparing
                for “all night long” for a long time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade turned on the heater in the room, and I switched my phone from Do Not Disturb mode
                to
                Airplane mode this time; I could see that there were more WeChat messages and Whatsapp messages. Those
                messages
                can wait if needed forever. We stripped off our layers of clothing and she echoed my frustration about
                wearing
                so many layers in the winter. We were finally down to our inners. There was a pile of clothes next to
                the foot
                of her queen-sized bed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Both of us hesitated to take the first step. What if this was not as good as we hoped
                it would
                be? After about a minute of eying each other and hesitating, we reached for each other and sat on the
                bed and
                started kissing each other again. My restraint was all but gone. I started kissing her all over her
                body. She
                was getting more excited and her breathing was getting heavier and heavier.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tried to remove her brassiere, but she pushed my hand away. I was surprised as my
                assumption
                was we were going to go all the way. For a second, I thought there was some misunderstand and my idea of
                “making
                love, all night long” was different from her idea of “making love, all night long”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You first, I want to see you naked”, she whispered hoarsely.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I removed my underwear and except my Fitbit, I was completely naked. I got back on to
                the bed
                too, kneeled on the bed and waited for her to do her bit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh dear, you are very beautiful”, she said looking at me. I have never been called
                attractive
                in my life and the comment that I am “beautiful” made me blush. Guess all the workout paid off. Despite
                the
                dimness in the room and my dusky skin tone the blush showed. She saw the blush and started giggling.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She got out of the bed slowly unclasped her brassiere and removed it sensually. Her
                skimpy
                panties followed and she was laid bare before my eyes. She was perfect with the perfect curves and firm
                body.
                She had a small scar under her right breast but otherwise, she was flawless. I loved the fact that she
                had
                chosen to not to wax or shave her womanhood. I could see that she was getting excited.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My eyes might have lingered too long down there, and she quickly covered her womanhood
                with the
                right hand.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am sorry, I don’t like shaving down there”, she said shyly, and added quickly “I can
                shave
                if you are turned off by the hair.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I quickly get out the bed, walked to her, removed her hand, looked into her eyes and
                told her
                sincerely, “You are perfect and you look beautiful the way you are. I was just lost for words and was
                thinking
                about how lucky I am to have known you. Don’t change one thing!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I went back and sat on the edge of the bed, slipped on a condom and dragged her close
                to me.
                She knew instinctively what I wanted, and she got on top of me. She kissed me passionately and I could
                feel the
                heat radiating from her centre. I pull her closer to me and felt her breast pressing against my chest.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">One moment we were two different entities, the next moment we became one.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We started hesitantly, touching each other and trying to understand each other’s body.
                We made
                love gently, passionately, slowly and urgently. Seven years of bottled up passion came bursting out that
                night.
                The bedroom was filled with the beautiful sound of our passion. We made love through the night, losing
                count of
                how many times we made love. We couldn’t get enough of each other, the first three or four time the mere
                smell
                and taste of each other were enough for us to start making love again, and we peaked quite fast. We were
                willing
                and eager to give each other more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Later, when one of us thinks we were done, the other would find a way to coax arousal
                from the
                other and make love again. It was a never-ending treasure hunt. We explored each other with our hand,
                lips,
                mouth, tongue and our bodies. We lived our imagination to the fullest. Each time we peaked, we did it
                together
                and reached higher newer highs we thought was not possible. Finally, when we stopped in the wee hours of
                the
                morning, we were fully spent and covered in each-others sweat and smells. We were not yet satisfied, but
                we were
                truly tired, and I had run out of condoms as well.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we lay there cuddled against each other and gently caressing each other’s body, I
                was sure
                that I didn’t want to be with anyone else. Yes, I was selfish – There was no way I could experience this
                with
                anyone else. Everything else and everyone else was a blur, but then I was not sure what Jade’s thoughts
                were
                about us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">More than once, that night the scary four-letter word – love – came to my mind, but I
                had
                pushed it firmly out of my mind as I thought it was a stupid thought to entertain. It was not that I was
                falling
                in love with Jade but had fantasised how would it feel to be in love with someone like Jade. That
                fleeting
                thought came with its baggage of doubts and questions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Would it be a jealous love or a generous love? Would I be able to make her happy and
                take care
                of her? Would I be able to respect and trust her without any boundaries? Would she accept me for what I
                am, a
                simple middle-class Indian guy? Was this just a fleeting burst of pent-up passion or was this something
                real?
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could feel Jade’s eyes on me, as I was lost in these thoughts. She was looking at me,
                but not
                seeing me. She also seemed to be lost in thought as well.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 14. Penny for Your Thoughts</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I don’t know when I dozed off but when I woke up, we were still in each other’s arms,
                and I
                realised how thirsty and hungry I felt. She should also be feeling the same.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade was lying in my arms with her hands gently caressing my chest. Her eyes were
                closed and
                she had a smile of satisfaction on her face. I should ask her if she needed something.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I caressed her shoulder eliciting a gentle moan of satisfaction from her smiling lips,
                and I
                asked her, “Do you want something to drink, dar… Jade?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I bit back the ‘darling’ that nearly slipped out. If she noticed it, she ignored it.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes dear, I would love some red wine and some water; I think you have seen my wine
                cabinet. I
                have few bottles of drinking water on the kitchen counter”, she said with her eyes closed, with a smile
                on her
                face as she slipped in the ‘dear’ into her response. Her eyes suddenly flew open, and she added, “Oh…
                There are
                some dark chocolate truffles in the fridge, can you get us some? I am starving.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could do with some unhealthy calories too.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Lovely, let me go get it for you,” I said, jumping out of the bed, ensuring that I
                don’t step
                into our pile of clothes. I pulled on my underwear and stepped out into the now warm hall. She hadn’t
                turned off
                the heater in the living room.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The wine glasses were on the coffee table, where Jade had left it. I picked up a Yellow
                Tail
                wine, which was a Shiraz reserve and the wine bottle opener. I picked up two bottles of drinking water
                from the
                kitchen countertop. I opened the fridge, picked up a box of dark chocolate truffles and headed back into
                the
                bedroom, carefully balancing everything in my two arms.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could see the outline of Jade’s body in the bed. She was doing something with her
                phone. A
                minute later, soft music filled the air. I saw that she had a JBL Flip on her ornate study table and
                that’s
                where the music was coming from. She locked and put away the phone. She got out the bed to help me when
                she saw
                me precariously balancing all those bottles and chocolates.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She took the water bottles from my arms and kept it one the night table. I placed the
                wine
                glasses on the table, opened the wine bottle and poured out two glasses. I opened water bottles and
                offered one
                to Jade. We both finished the water in a few seconds, and I realised that she was still naked. I fished
                out my
                pullover and my t-shirt from the pile of clothes. I wore my t-shirt and gave the pullover to Jade, who
                slipped
                it on and whispered a “thanks”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I sat next to her and offered her one of the wine glasses. We clinked the wine glasses
                and
                started drinking the wine. She started peeling the foil off the chocolates and started eating them. I
                stared at
                the chocolate like a hungry puppy and started making tiny puppy-like whining noises. She popped a few of
                them
                into my mouth, giggling all the while.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I stopped making those noises and finished the wine. I could sense that she was in a
                pensive
                mood and I hoped that she was not regretting this. She was still savouring the wine and enjoying the
                chocolate,
                so I refilled my glass and started sipping the wine slowly. I moved my wine glass to my left hand and
                moved
                close to Jade until our shoulders were touching. She seemed deep in thought and I wanted to be there for
                her if
                she wanted to talk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Penny for your thoughts?” I asked her as gently as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hmm?” she looked up questioningly, her eyes shining in the dark.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I mean, you have that look. As if there is something you want to get off your mind. I
                am here
                if you want to talk Jade” I looked as genuine as I sounded. I put down my wine glass as it was starting
                to go
                through my head. I had started craving for some real food also.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She continued to sip the wine in silence until she was done with the wine. I topped up
                her
                glass, corked the bottle and place it next to my wine glass. She was taking some time to make up her
                mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She finally looked at me, her eyes shifting between my left and right eye, and said, “I
                want to
                tell you something, Anand. I want you to listen with an open mind and I hope you don’t judge me. I want
                you to
                think about this very seriously and let me know what you think. I know this will sound a bit abrupt, but
                I have
                had a lot of time to think about this.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was very serious and I knew from her face that this was going to be some deep
                pent-up
                thought that she has been holding on to for some time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am no one to judge you, Jade, so please tell me whatever you want to tell me”, I
                told her
                reassuringly with a decisive nod of my head.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She took a sip of the wine, took a deep breath and started talking.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, you have always been in my heart since we first met seven years back. You have
                stayed
                there in my heart through all the ups and downs in my life, and you came back into my life just when I
                wanted
                you to come back into my life. I don’t believe in coincidences and I think this is one of those moments
                that was
                meant to happen. I now have more money than I can spend now thanks to my inheritance from my father and
                I want
                nothing else in life now, other than… giving us, giving this a shot. I guess, what I’m trying to say is
                that I
                like you very much. You were always respectful, committed and had your values, strange as it was for me
                back
                then, now it makes sense to me. Despite the stupidity of my youth, you remained respectful to me and
                were a good
                friend to me until we drifted apart.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew at that point what she wanted, though it should have been obvious to someone
                with a bit
                more intelligence when she asked me to be “open-minded”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If it is okay for you, can we try seeing each other for some time? For most parts,
                Anand, you
                are a reserved person and you tend to hold back your thoughts, so I am asking you this. The chemistry
                between us
                is great. It’s more than great, it is fantastic, but I want this to be more than just a physical
                relationship. I
                tried to picture you and me together, and that was a good picture. I want us to get to know each other
                better. I
                want us to see if we can go beyond a physical relationship only.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I managed to keep a straight face since the thought of us going beyond just a physical
                relationship had come up quite a few times in the night when we were making love. I liked Jade, and here
                she is,
                asking if we can give us a shot at a serious relationship. She was studying my face to try and gauge my
                reaction
                and I showed her my thoughtful listening face. She took another sip of the wine and continued.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If you think that this is workable for us, then I would like us to be in an exclusive
                relationship.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She paused for a minute to allow that to sink into me. I smiled and nodded. I knew that
                if I
                agreed to see Jade, I wouldn’t want to think of anyone else. I had remained largely impassive when she
                was
                talking, so she emphasised, “I know you need some time to think about this, but I do want you to think
                about
                this.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She had no idea how close I was to jump into this, but I needed to think seriously
                about this.
                I slowed myself down.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am feeling really hungry. Are you hungry, Anand?” she asked me abruptly changing the
                subject. Perhaps she was worried that I would reject without giving it any thought. Before I could say
                anything
                and my stomach made an involuntary rumbling noise in response.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She giggled and pecked me quickly on my lips and said “Let me make some pancakes and
                coffee for
                you. You do like pancakes, right?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I love pancakes. Let me help you and please don’t say no”, I told her, trying not to
                let my
                hunger show when I spoke.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I wasn’t going to say no. I want your help. No free breakfast. Oh, by the way, if we
                are
                trying this, don’t expect me to do everything”, she stuck her tongue out playfully.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That thought never crossed my mind”, I replied earnestly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Good, now let’s get dressed and let start cooking. I am starving”, she said, pushing
                me
                playfully off the bed.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 15. Making Pancakes Her Way</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">We dressed up quickly, and when she removed the pullover to dress up, I was reminded
                how
                perfect she was. She blushed a bit under my unabashed stare and it was my turn to giggle.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She wanted to use the bathroom and freshen up a bit. I wanted to use the bathroom as
                well, but
                I could wait.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could see some of the stealth wealth in her kitchen. Her chimneys were imported, so
                was the
                kitchen stove. Her utensils, knives and cutlery were all from either Zwilling J.A. Henckels or some
                Japanese
                brands made with hand-folded steel. She seemed to use Tupperware for almost all storage. A quick look at
                the
                food cabinets and the refrigerator. Most of the food seemed to come from some imported food store or
                organic
                foods store.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She came into the kitchen, looking renewed and refreshed, and noticed that I was
                exploring her
                kitchen. She blushed a bit, and added shyly, “I like to cook, so I spend money on these sort of things”.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I like to cook too, just that right now most of my utensils, knives and cutlery are
                from Ikea.
                I will feel a bit embarrassed to invite you home,” I said with a smile.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“God! You are an idiot, Anand. I don’t care about all these things. You said you are
                single.
                Now invite me to your home and cook for me… And you better cook some Indian food for me. No matter where
                your
                kitchenware or utensils are from”, she said with her hands folded across her chest. She was smiling, but
                I knew
                that she was waiting expectantly for a response from me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Alright, Alright, I promise to invite you to spend time with me on a weekend, as soon
                as I
                perfect a couple of recipes I have been experimenting with. That way I can show off my cooking skills to
                you”, I
                said with a bit of flourish. I hoped that she doesn’t end up hating my cooking so much that she will
                change her
                mind about us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Good! Do you have any nut allergies? I do remember, you are allergic to crustaceans. I
                want to
                serve my special pancakes with butter, peanut butter, maple syrup and honey”, she inquired as she took
                out four
                eggs from the fridge and cracked them one by one into the food processor bowl. She carefully removed two
                yolks
                and discarded it down the sink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nope, I am not allergic to anything else”, I replied as she added a large pinch of
                salt and a
                cup of full cream milk. I was a bit surprised that she still remembered my crustacean allergy. She’s
                just so
                amazing and thoughtful. Why am I even thinking so much about giving this relationship a shot? I should
                man up
                and just say ‘yes’. I also made a mental note to remember what she liked and what she didn’t.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She proceeded to add a tablespoon of stevia, half a cup of vanilla whey protein and
                blended
                this for two minutes. In another bowl, she mixed one cup of oats flour, half a cup of whole wheat flour,
                a
                tablespoon each of flax seeds and chia seeds, one teaspoon baking soda and a quarter teaspoon baking
                powder. I
                helped her mix the mixture until it looked evenly distributed. We slowly blended in the dry mix into the
                wet mix
                using the blender itself, until the batter looked creamy enough. Some people say lumps in pancakes are
                okay, I
                guess Jade and I didn’t share that belief. I quickly washed the bowl and wiped it clean with a paper
                kitchen
                towel. Jade poured out the batter into the bowl and using a spatula got out the last bits of the batter
                into the
                bowl.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Does it look a bit thick to you?” she asked after studying the batter for few seconds.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I nodded my agreement and said, “A little, I think you can add a little milk or water”.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">She added some more milk and stirred the batter until it had a familiar pancake
                consistency.
                While she did this, I found out where she had kept her pan, and I found that she had four kinds of pans.
                I
                selected the flat one, rinsed it under the running water and wiped it clean with the kitchen towel. Jade
                seemed
                pleased with the choice of the pan and, my compulsion to clean everything. I place it on the kitchen
                top. I
                didn’t fire up the stove yet, as Jade had covered the bowl with a cling wrap and started a twenty-minute
                timer
                to rest the batter.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Can you help to get the butter from the fridge?” she asked me as she started putting
                away
                ingredients. She brought out a box of Nespresso capsules, a Nespresso VertuoLine coffee machine, and a
                milk
                steamer from one of the cabinets. She got out two cups, which were white IKEA 365 cups; I recognised the
                cups as
                these were the ones I used at my home.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I found the butter in the chill tray and it was some imported brand from New Zealand,
                called
                Alpine. I made sure that I got the unsalted one. I placed the butter in the saucer, that Jade had kept
                next to
                the batter. Meanwhile, Jade had poured in some milk into the steamer and started it. She selected two
                Livanto
                Espresso capsules for herself and I selected two Capriccio coffee capsules for myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“How do you like your coffee?” she asked me, which sort of indicated to me that she
                likes to
                drink her coffee with milk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I like it with very little milk in the morning for the first cup. For my second cup, I
                take it
                black. During the day, I like to drink Latte”, I said, explaining my preferences. I quickly realised in
                my
                present state I shared too much too quickly. She made my first cup of coffee for me and added a bit of
                the
                steamed milk. She then made a double shot latte for herself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stepped out into the apartment balcony to enjoy the coffee with a cigarette. We lit
                up our
                respective cigarettes and sipped our coffees, enjoying the warmth of the coffee. I wanted to ask her if
                she had
                any other thoughts or if she wanted to know something about these past seven years of my life, or maybe
                that
                comes after I have made up my mind. I didn’t care about her past, but if she wanted to tell me
                something, it’s
                up to her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I know you might have questions about the past, but I want to assure you that my past
                is in
                the past and there is nothing that will come back to haunt us”, she said at the exact moment. I can
                never
                understand how most women around me can read my mind so easily. I might usually end up meeting people
                who can
                easily read my mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both heard the faint ‘ding’ as the kitchen timer reached the 20-minute mark. Jade
                and headed
                back into the kitchen. I turned on the stove and Jade discarded the cling wrap and mixed the batter
                again. I
                tried to stifle a yawn, which Jade caught from the corner of her eye.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Why don’t you go and rest a while if you want? I can do this.” Jade volunteered.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am good. We had a very active night, which is why I am a bit tired”, I said with a
                cheeky
                smile on my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She punched my shoulder playfully and said “You pervert! At least go and freshen up. I
                have
                kept out some towels and a spare toothbrush.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She showed me to the bathroom and added, “And… once you come back, don’t just stand
                there
                staring at me. Help me slice the butter into half-inch cubes.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I drained the rest of the coffee before, heading to her bathroom which as extremely
                utilitarian
                but was well laid out. I used the toilet and brushed my teeth. My clothes smelled okay, so I stripped
                down and
                stood under the cold shower for a full two minutes before turning off the faucet. I towelled myself dry,
                dressed
                up again, and headed back into the kitchen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade had set the table with a pair of plates, cutlery and glasses. She had poured some
                more
                milk into the steamer and had taken out four more Espresso capsules. She did not indicate noticing I had
                showered. She was stirring the pancake batter and seemed deep in thought. She was probably thinking as
                to how to
                tell me whatever she wanted to tell me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I opened the foil-cover of the butter paper, placed it on a heavy bamboo cutting board,
                washed
                the knife in ice-cold water and sliced out two half-inch-thick slices of the butter while ensuring that
                I don’t
                damage the foil. Rewrapping the butter is a nightmare if you damage the foil. I then proceeded to cut
                the butter
                into little half-inch cubes and dropped them into the bowl of ice water Jade had prepared for me. I had
                to do
                this fast to ensure that the butter didn’t melt from the heat of my hands. We had some forty-odd little
                cubes
                waiting to be consumed. I rewrapped the butter in the foil and put it back into the fridge. Jade was
                testing the
                heat of the pan with a drop of water and she looked satisfied. I washed the knife and the cutting board,
                wiped
                them carefully, and returned it to their appropriated place.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade took the bowl with the cubed cold butter, and carefully dropped a butter cube on
                to the
                pan. She spread the butter gently over to the pan using a spatula. Shen then ladled about a third of a
                cup of
                batter on to the pan. She had a smile of satisfaction when it spread evenly without much effort to form
                a nice
                round pancake. She then dropped a cube of butter on top before the trademark holes started forming. That
                was new
                for me, as I never added butter on top. The delicious smell of the buttery pancake filled the kitchen
                and I
                started salivating at the thought of eating a stack of peanut butter and maple syrup. Jade turned on the
                chimney
                to avoid the kitchen from getting smoky.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She flipped it at the right time – the holes were starting to form and the top firm
                enough. The
                melted butter on top sizzled when it hit the hot pan, sending another burst of butter flavour through
                the air.
                She cooked the pancake for 2 minutes more. This was the test preparation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She slid the pancake off the pan onto a plate and poked it with a toothpick to see if
                it was
                cooked inside. The toothpick came out clean and she smiled and whispered “Perfect”. She proceeded to
                make the
                rest of the pancakes in batches of three, until we a total of twelve little pancakes, four each for us,
                and four
                extras in case, we were feeling hungrier. She covered the remaining bowls of batter and butter cubes
                with a
                cling wrap before keeping the bowls in the fridge.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She made me a black coffee and made herself another double latte. We dug into the
                pancakes and
                polished off our pancakes in less than 10 minutes. After a slight hesitation from both of us, the extra
                pancakes
                disappeared as well. She had her pancakes with some Manuka honey and butter. I had mine with lots of
                peanut
                butter and maple syrup. It was the first time I have had this kind of pancake, and it was surprisingly
                delicious. This amazing breakfast deserved a cigarette or two.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I think I have the most readable face in the world, as at that exact moment Jade said,
                “You
                look like you want a smoke. I could use a cigarette myself.”</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365565">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 16. One More Request</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">We took the coffee to the balcony and light up a cigarette each. I sighed a sigh of
                satisfaction as the cigarette pushed the oxytocin high from sex and serotonin high from the breakfast,
                even
                higher. I could see that Jade was experiencing something similar as her eyes were closed and she had a
                faint
                smile of satisfaction on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The sunlight fell on her face and highlighted her features. Now that I have lived in
                China long
                enough, it was easier to see the European features in her. The shape of her cheekbones, the nose, the
                shape and
                colour of her eyes were so different from your average Chinese. Nicole was certainly beautiful, but
                except her
                nose, her features were typical of Chinese. Jade had beautiful features, and when all those features
                came
                together, she was pleasing to the eyes but not stunningly beautiful, but still very much out of my
                league. My
                thoughts came back to what Jade had asked me when her voice interrupted my thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I have another request if you do want us to try this… relationship. I want us to get
                tested,
                as I prefer using birth control pills, rather than condoms. I do like us to have the option of being
                spontaneous”, she added hesitantly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I can understand her trepidation, as she was not sure of my history. The general
                perception of
                foreigners was generally unfavourable and some of us are perceived as a promiscuous bunch. Perhaps she
                shared
                the same concern.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The way I understood this request is as a way to bury our past should we agree to go
                forward
                with this. I am happy to get tested as many times as needed, but I was not sure about not using condoms.
                I was
                not ready for unplanned pregnancies. I just don’t trust birth control pills. This is probably one point
                I will
                have to push back on.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Understand, I am okay for us to get tested. I am just not sure about not using
                condoms… birth
                control pills can be unreliable sometimes”, I replied. What I’d hoped to convey at that moment was that
                I am
                seriously thinking about what she asked from us and, also convey that I was not interested in accidental
                pregnancies at this point of time, however serious we might become.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“And Jade… To be honest, I had the same thought of giving us a try, but I have been
                thinking
                about this, uh… more recently than you. I do need some time to think as I don’t want to ruin what we
                have by
                rushing into this”, I added hastily.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I want you to think about this, very seriously”, she replied, stressing on the words
                ‘very
                seriously’, “As I indicated before, I had a lot of time to think about this. Take as much time as you
                want to
                think, but I want you to know that whatever is your decision, I will respect it”, she said.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Perhaps it was my imagination, but I detected a bit of sadness in her voice when she
                said that.
                It was almost as if she was saddened by the thought that I might not agree.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I drew her close to me and gave her a quick hug and kiss. This pacified her and her
                beautiful
                smile was back. I wanted to make love to her again then and there, but I held back as the timing was
                inappropriate and more importantly, I didn’t have any condoms left with me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, I understand”, I said, but not because I understood her completely, but because I
                had
                nothing else to say. I am completely useless when I’m sleep deprived and after a night of sex.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We had reached a point where we had nothing more to talk about, so we finished our
                respective
                coffees and cigarettes in silence.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am going to change the passcode today…” she said as we headed back to the apartment,
                and
                added with a naughty wink, “I will change it to today’s date. It was worth the wait.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Aww, I’m touched. You shouldn’t have told me that, I can just walk in and take
                advantage of
                you… Even before I have made up my mind”, I said with an impish smile and a wiggle of my eyebrow.
                <em>Perhaps
                    not too useless after all,</em> I said to myself at my attempted wit<em>.</em>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“We will see who is taking advantage of whom. I am hoping you would make up your mind,
                then let
                me know, so that we can take advantage of each other for some time to come”, she retorted not willing to
                be
                one-upped by a man. We both laughed and stayed away from each other as I could feel that we both wanted
                to rush
                into each other’s arm make love again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The attraction was tangible. Did I tell you before, we were like two magnets forcefully
                separated? Our breaths were shallow and our lips dry as we tried to calm down. Jade’s pupils were
                dilated and I
                was sure that my eyes were dilated as well. I was itching to throw caution in the wind, but I was saved
                by the
                bell, rather my phone’s weekend alarm which reminded me it was 8:30 AM, on Sunday. Workday alarms were
                set at
                5:30, 6:00 and 6:30 in the AM.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We were both equally startled and we both started laughing embarrassingly at the fact
                we were
                this close to madness. I took out the phone and killed the alarm.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Looks like it’s time to head back home. I am on leave the next week and will be in
                Shanghai
                during the spring festival. We can meet for lunch or coffee… outside”, I suggested and added the
                ‘outside’
                quickly to ensure that there would be no misunderstanding as to why we are meeting.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Haha, you don’t need to justify everything you say. I understood you perfectly”, she
                said
                laughing at my blundering efforts to sound politically correct. I could sense she had something else to
                say, and
                as expected she continued, “But, I will be travelling tomorrow to Palermo in Italy with my mother and
                grandparents from my mother’s side to take care of some of the legal aspects for my inheritance from my
                father,
                and then a holiday in Europe. We can meet only after I come back, which is a week after the spring
                festival, or
                three weeks from now.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was crestfallen and my face showed it, I was hoping to meet her and get to know a bit
                more
                about her. Seeing my dejected expression, she tried to pacify me, “Anand, this is a good thing, as you
                have will
                have time for yourself and you can use this opportunity to think objectively about us. If you need to
                talk we
                can always talk on WeChat.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You are right, I do need some time to think objectively about this. I want you to know
                that I
                am dying to say yes, but I don’t want to hurt you by rushing into this”, I replied acknowledging that
                the
                three-week separation is the best for us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Her face lit up with my ‘dying to say yes’ comment. I drew her into my arms and against
                my
                chest and embraced her and she embraced me back with an intensity that showed how much she cared for me.
                I
                didn’t dare give a name to what I felt and what she might be feeling.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>No,</em> I told myself, <em>you need to think really hard about this. For now, let
                    her
                    go.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gently let her go and could see that her face was tilted upward in expectation of a
                kiss.
                Instead, I give her a respectful kiss on her cheeks, smiled and said, “Take care Jade, I need to go now.
                I will
                see you in three weeks.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If she was disappointed, she hid it well with a dazzling smile. She nodded in agreement
                and
                hugged me again. She mumbled something into my chest.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What? I didn’t catch that”, I told her as I let her go.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I said, I am going to miss you a lot”, she said, looking up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I will miss you too Jade”, I replied and that seemed to pacify her. I had already
                started
                missing her. I wanted to meet her once more before I go, maybe for dinner. I should ask her right away,
                and then
                cancel on Nicole, but unfortunately, I am not that kind of a friend; I don’t cancel on my friends.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew that I can see Jade on WeChat, but that is not seeing her. No electronic
                communication
                in the world can yet replace this feeling of togetherness, that fact that I could smell her, feel the
                warmth and
                affection radiating from her, hear her breathing, her eyes begging me to stay and go at the same time,
                and her
                hands on my arms not willing to let me go.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She let go of my hand hesitantly, walked me to the main door and saw me off. As I
                stepped out,
                I turned back to see her and she was standing on the pedestal, a lot of expectation written on her face.
                With
                Jade watching, I walked down the flight of stairs and when I reached the first landing, I was gripped by
                an
                illogical thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>What if she changes her mind in the coming three weeks? What if she finds someone
                    better in
                    Italy?</em> I turned around to see Jade standing there at the pedestal, with a strange look on her
                face. It
                almost looked like fear to me. It was then it hit me - <em>Did she share the same fear?</em> I stood
                there at
                the first landing, she at the pedestal and we were looking searchingly at each other’s face to
                understand what
                was going on in each other’s minds. I would have given anything to know what was going on in her mind.
                What
                exactly did she feel about me?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, I… I like you very much. I hope you can feel that. I will be thinking of you
                every
                second. Please think about this… about us seriously”, Jade called out across the gap, and breaking the
                uneasy
                silence, almost as if in response to my thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Jade, me too… I mean, I will be thinking about you, about us, every second for the
                next three
                weeks. I will see you once you are back”, I replied.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We hastily exchanged ‘goodbyes’ before we did something illogical like rushing into
                each
                other’s arms again. I started walking down the stairs after Jade hesitantly closed the door.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I walked down the stairs, a thought hit me hard. I was scared to admit how much I
                liked her
                at that point, as I was seeing her after such a long time. But, to be perfectly honest, I was even more
                afraid
                that I might just be infatuated with her. If I am just infatuated, I would know it in three or four
                days, the
                worst case within a week.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I have been infatuated and in love before, many times, and I know how that felt, and
                this felt
                completely different. I have had a few superficial relationships and I know how that felt – I would wake
                up in
                the morning to see the lady gone or I would leave the lady’s home without disturbing her; this depends
                on whose
                house we were in or which hotel we ended up in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This didn’t feel superficial, and this didn’t feel like infatuation, and it was scary
                feeling
                not knowing what exactly the relationship was. As I stepped out into the courtyard and started walking
                toward
                the general direction of the metro station, I had a strong feeling that this might be a relationship
                that might
                lead to something, that went beyond any of those relationships I had in the past, including a failed
                marriage
                when I was 27, which was a well-kept secret in the family and a close circle of friends.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This failed marriage had left me unable to think of any long-term relationships and had
                broken
                my spirit for a long time. I never expected that a person I knew and loved for 7 years since my college
                days
                would leave me in the first week of our marriage… No, not leave… Ran away with someone she met a mere
                six months
                ago.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Thanks to a clause in the Indian marriage act, and family connections, the marriage was
                annulled in the next couple of weeks. The shame was too much for me to bear, and I was on the verge of
                going
                into depressive mania, but my parents and my friends never gave up on me and eventually helped me
                recover.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I left India that very year and vowed never to go back to India. Also, I vowed to never
                fall in
                love again, which kept me from ever getting too close to anyone. Interestingly, it also made me a bit
                more
                empathetic and understanding of others feelings.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was always the perfect friend, but never the perfect partner. This was the hidden
                side of me,
                Anand the smiling guy who’s shy, friendly and polite, but could never hold on or never made an effort to
                hold
                on, to a girlfriend for more than a year, other than that one girl I got serious about… serious enough
                to invest
                my life savings into an expensive education (which in retrospect was one of the best decisions of my
                life).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was close to the metro stop and I decided to put all these thoughts on the back
                burner, as
                there is no way I could think normally when I was emotionally charged up and confused. I didn’t want to
                think of
                my past and my failures. It was time to turn my attention to my phone, which was ignored for so long. I
                was not
                sure how the battery lasted so long… <em>Ah yes, I had put my phone into the Airplane mode.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">I entered the metro stop and stood on the platform waiting for the train to come.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was time to open the floodgates and let the messages in.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 17. An Evening’s Worth of Text Messages</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I was half-afraid of what would happen when I turn off the Airplane mode and I
                discovered that
                my fears were well-founded. The moments I connected to the network, the phone was flooded with about
                eleven
                hours’ worth of message notifications. Here’s what I am going to do, I am going to categorize it by
                people who
                sent me the messages rather than the message source (SMS, iMessage, Whatsapp or WeChat).</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Parents</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">They had messaged me inquiring about my health and how come I didn’t turn up for the
                weekly
                video call on WeChat. We usually have the call at around 9 PM on Saturday evenings, my time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I texted back and lied to them that ‘I was down with a bit of cold’, and that ‘I had
                put the
                phone on Airplane mode’ (that bit was true of course), and that ‘had gone off to sleep early’ (a lie
                again – I
                didn’t sleep one bit during the night).</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Allen Huang</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">A train heading in my direction had arrived on the platform and I had boarded that
                train.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If one were to read Allen’s message, he or she would feel that Allen was on the verge
                of mental
                breakdown. There were five text messages, eight WeChat messages and four missed call alerts, all in a
                space of
                two hours spanning from around 10 PM to midnight. This is how the messages went.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Dude, did you accept the request from Alice?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Dude, I am sorry, don’t be pissed off at me.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Missed call alert (Text): You have (two) missed call(s) from Allen Huang</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (iMessage): WTF Dude, why are you not answering my calls?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (iMessage): Oh okay, your phone is turned off... Sorry.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (iMessage): Hey man! Why’s your phone turned off. Is it what I think it is?
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Allen has known me for a long time and he knew there could be only two reasons why I
                would turn
                off my phone, 1) I had worked overtime or 2) I met a girl and since whole China was on a break and he
                knew I was
                not working, he instinctively knew it had to be the second reason.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Possibly realising he was using iMessage, switches over to WeChat</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Jean said, she just saw the messages Alice sent you. She was upset
                and
                apologetic. Jean apologised on behalf of Alice. You know that that is very rare.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): What exactly did she say? Jean didn’t say anything to me.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Whatever it is, just ignore her okay? You are an awesome guy and
                deserve
                better than that crazy lady.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Missed call alert (Text): You have (one) missed call(s) from Allen Huang</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Bro, I hope you got lucky and that’s why your cell phone is off
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): When you turn cell back on, I want you to delete Alice’s messages,
                and
                forget anything happened.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Half an hour later.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): I hope you are not upset with me.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Missed call alert (Text): You have (one) missed call(s) from Allen Huang</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (iMessage): Okay dude, call me when you can. I hope you don’t read those
                messages.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After this, there were no messages from Allen. Since he begged me to not to read
                Alice’s
                messages, the only obvious thing to do was to read those messages, but I needed to reply to Allen first.
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Dude I am okay. I didn’t read her messages. I will delete it.
                Sorry,
                I had turned off my phone. Talk more when we meet.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">He responded immediately.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen (WeChat): Okay dude. That’s good. Hope you got lucky ;-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was not going to take the bait and didn’t reply to that message.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Alice Wang</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">The first message was relatively harmless; obviously, this was not the message Allen
                was
                talking about.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Alice Wang (WeChat): Hi, yes nice to meet you too.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">About an hour or so later, during which, she possibly browsed my WeChat moments (a
                social
                timeline like that of Facebook), she messaged back. This is the verbatim of her message, with
                grammatical errors
                and all that.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Alice Wang (WeChat): Hi Anand, Jean and Allen didn’t tell me before that you are
                from
                Indian. Please don’t mind if I say this but I don’t date people from Indian and Pakistan.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Alice Wang (WeChat): You all are big cheats, and you country full of rapists. You
                know, I
                have to be honest, we Chinese people generally don’t like you, country people. And I prefer American or
                European
                people now. Sorry, I don’t think I can go out with someone like you.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Alice Wang (WeChat): Also, I found from Jean that you don’t have a car or
                apartment in
                China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Ok… Wow! Even at my age, there is a first time for everything! That was the first time,
                I have
                experienced real discrimination in China, at least from people who are of my generation. The comment
                about car
                and apartment is a fairly common one, so I was impervious to that comment. Usually, I would have sent
                back a
                nasty response and tried to educate her about India but I was still basking in the afterglow of sex and
                my
                thoughts were mostly about Jade and how should I respond to Jade’s request (you can see that under
                messages from
                Jade). And, yes, she thought my country is called ‘Indian’. So, my response, fully expecting Alice to
                have
                blocked me, was simple.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Ok whatever, good luck finding whatever you want :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Surprisingly, the message went through, so I went into her profile and blocked her from
                seeing
                my moments and muted her. This is just in case she continues to spy on my moments or she feels the urge
                messaging me back. In retrospect, I should have blocked her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The train had reached my stop and I had gotten off the train.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Jean Li</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Now that Allen’s messages made sense, Jean’s rare message was no surprise to me. She
                had sent
                and recalled two messages, and the one that finally remained in the chat log was this one.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jean Li (WeChat): Sorry, Anand. I didn’t expect Alice to act this way. Please
                don’t be
                upset.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jean might be a hard ass sometimes, but she liked me and trusted me, and today, I liked
                the
                fact that she was willing to lose face in front of me.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): I didn’t read her messages, Allen asked me not to. So, I
                guess I am
                okay.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I can’t go and tell Jean a different story and cause confusion.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I have learnt long back that, the trick behind lying is consistency. The message and
                the story
                have to be consistent, no matter where you tell it, whom you tell it to and when you tell it. Visualize
                it
                happened, live that event in your mind and believe it happened.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She messaged a few minutes later.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jean Li (WeChat): Oh, that is a relief. Still, you find out new things about
                people you
                thought you knew. I am sorry again. Next time we meet you should sing the whole of Xiao Pingguo for us
                :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Right! As if I will ever sing a Chinese song ever again in my life!</em> I thought
                when I
                tapped out the response.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Sure, looking forward to it.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Nicole Zhang</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">I was less nervous about reading Nicole’s messages now that I knew where Nicole stood
                in my
                perspective.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The first couple of messages was sent at around midnight on Saturday when I was asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hi, Anand, thanks for your help. Really do appreciate it. I
                hope
                you don’t get the wrong message from the way I behaved. Even though we just met, I would like to think
                of you as
                my friend.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nope… I am happy to stay in the friend zone. Now that things might get serious with
                Jade, more
                than happy.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): I look forward to meeting tomorrow for dinner.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The next message was sent at about 10:00 PM on Saturday.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hi, Anand, I am sorry, something came up for tomorrow
                evening. We
                will have to meet some other time. Monday or Tuesday okay for you? We can meet by 6:00 PM on either of
                these
                days. Let’s meet there directly. Very sorry again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A huge wave of relief hit me as I read this message. I don’t have to cancel on Nicole.
                This was
                great news</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hi Nicole, no problems at all. Let’s try to meet on Monday at
                Blue
                Frog. They have offers on burgers and a nice happy hour. PS: I consider you as a friend as well :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole messaged back when I was about to message Jade and ask her out for dinner.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Good :-), See you on Monday.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was halfway back home at this point.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Jade Lin</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Now that I am not meeting Nicole, I wanted to message Jade and ask her out for dinner
                on
                Sunday, as she was leaving on Monday, but Jade had messaged me twenty or so minutes back.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): I am going to miss you so much, my dear Anand. I now hate the
                fact I am
                going away for three weeks. Do you think we can meet today evening?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): I miss you, Anand. I am not saying this to force you into a
                decision.
                Take as much time as you want, but I genuinely miss being with you. I wish you had stayed back for some
                more
                time or even better, travelled with me and my family, even though it is too soon. You looked like you
                could do
                with a break.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I realised that I was missing her too and quite suddenly the fear of losing her gripped
                me
                again and immediately realised that such fears were unfounded.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In less than half-an-hour, Jade had started missing me, and I could feel deep inside me
                that
                whatever we shared was meant to go on for a long time.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): I miss you too darling. I wish I could take a break and
                travel with
                you, but given that I am an Indian, there is no way I can travel with you tomorrow :-). In any case,
                since you
                are travelling tomorrow, may I invite you for a drink and dinner today evening at TGI Friday’s by the
                Bund?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hit sent and waited for her response with my fingers crossed. I was nearly home. I
                should be
                feeling sleepy, but I was feeling quite okay. I couldn’t stop thinking about her.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Absolutely, I would love that. Shall we meet at Lujiazui
                Station, Exit
                2, say by 5:00 PM?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Something inside me leapt with joy and I let out a shot whoop of joy. People stopped to
                stare
                at me. I grinned like an idiot and continued walking.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Sounds like a date.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Yes, it is. You better be there on time. ;-)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I don’t think I will be late. On the contrary, I will be there twenty minutes early.
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Of course, darling. Now go sleep.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Okay, I will. You get some sleep. Have you reached home?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): I am about two minutes away. I am just entering my community.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I reached home about two minutes later and turned on the heater in my room. I stripped
                off my
                clothes and underwear and dumped them into the laundry basket. I stood under a cold shower and scrubbed
                myself
                clean. I towelled myself dry and changed into my sleeping gear and got into the bed. I took out the
                phone to
                find one more message from Jade.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): I am in bed now. The bed smells of you. God, I miss you.</p>

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">With that, I put my phone into Do Not Disturb mode. I also set an alarm for 3:00 PM and
                3:30
                PM. I then covered my eyes with my eye mask and went to sleep. I was out in less than ten minutes.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 18. Something Like A Dinner Date</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I woke up with a start as my 3:00 PM alarm blared. My heart was pounding hard in my
                chest, and
                that usually meant I had a nightmare (or a ‘daymare’ in this case). I ignored the alarm and took a few
                breaths
                to calm myself down. I removed the eye mask, silenced the alarm and got out of the bed, hesitantly. My
                heart was
                still pounding away as I walked to the kitchen to make my coffee. I tried to recall what the dream was
                about but
                couldn’t recall even the tiniest of the details. I gave up with a sigh, switched off the 3:30 PM alarm
                in
                advance and prepared my first coffee for the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">With my coffee in my hand, I headed out to the balcony for a smoke before I headed to
                the
                toilet. For some reason, I really couldn’t enjoy my smoke, I found it disgusting. I put out the
                cigarette after
                just a couple of puffs and finished my coffee as quickly as possible without burning my throat. I should
                have
                known that things are changing for me from that one incident, not finishing a cigarette while not sick.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I headed to the bathroom to finish my daily ablutions. The dream still bothered me but
                I firmly
                pushed it out of my mind by thinking about Jade and what she had proposed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The memory of time spent with her came rushing back to me and I felt warm all over. The
                ‘sceptical me’ and my head immediately tried to shoot it down as hormones and pheromones. The ‘believer
                me’ and
                my heart told me it was meant to go further if I can let go of the past and accept the now without
                worrying
                about the future… I needed to think hard about this.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finished my usual cold shower and went to the bedroom to dress up for the evening. I
                thought
                for about five minutes what I should be wearing, before giving up and deciding to go with the
                jeans-shirt-sweater combo. That’s as formal as it gets for me. I spend more time applying some hair
                products and
                setting my hair to look passably presentable. The improvement was at best, marginal. No hair product
                could fix
                my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I picked up my sports jacket from my closet and slipped two condoms into the inner
                pocket of
                the jacket, in case something was to happen in the night. Better to be prepared than regret later. I
                took out my
                hush puppies from the shoe cabinet and slipped it on. It was nearly 4:00 pm by the time I was done with
                a
                routine that usually takes me 30 to 35 minutes. This should have been the second indication that
                something was
                not quite the same, but this also somehow failed to register.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I unlocked my phone, turned off Do Not Disturb to check if Jade has cancelled on me,
                and
                strangely there was only one WeChat message from Jade, at around 2:00 PM, reminding me not to be late
                and a lot
                of hugs and kisses. The other messages were from my parents on WhatsApp, asking me to come on for a
                video ‘after
                lunch’, which is anywhere between 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM my time. If I left by 4:25 I can make it before
                5:00 PM to
                Lujiazui station. Not exactly twenty minutes early, but not late as well.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I started the video call with my parents in WeChat, and the first thing my mother and
                father
                noticed was how well my hair was set and “how handsome I looked”. I just brushed off the comment as
                parental
                affection. After all, to most normal parents, their offspring are the most beautiful thing that is there
                in the
                world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As usual, my mother, or Amma as I called her, wanted to talk about every relative in
                Bangalore.
                My father, or Achan as I called him, gave me a financial report of incomes and expenditures. I have told
                him
                several times that he need not tell me how they use the money I gave them. His finance and accounting
                background
                meant that there was no way he was going to stop until I reach financial “maturity”. He was also doing
                an
                analysis of portfolio that can give the best returns, and he felt that he found the right portfolio mix
                for me
                to invest in, and he decided to stay away from cryptocurrencies. I agreed to transfer over a part of my
                savings
                to him so that he can try out that portfolio.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">They then dived into the question they usually ask that signals the fact that the call
                must be
                concluded– “Did you have someone in your life? Can we start looking for a girl if you are single?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I gave them the same response I have been giving for past few years – “You will know as
                soon as
                I know and please don’t look for anyone”, but seeing the hopeful look on their faces, I added, “Okay,
                fine…
                Don’t get too excited, but, I am going to meet someone for dinner, let’s leave it at that for the time
                being.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Both Amma and Achan looked like they were going to burst with joy and break into a
                Bollywood
                dance number, as I never mentioned about any girl in the past few years. I have not seen them this
                happy, since
                forever. I have last seen them this happy when my sister gave birth to my niece, five years back. I was
                gripped
                by the fear of letting them down again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Amma, Acha, just to be clear. It is just a dinner, so please don’t get too excited,
                for the
                time being”, I explained hastily.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“We understand <em>moné</em> (son), we don’t mind if the girl is Chinese. We just want
                you to
                be happy”, they replied, already planning for the wedding in their heads, I could see it in their eyes.
                They
                were already calculating the number of guests to be invited and who all should be excluded. My father
                had this
                look on his face that usually meant he was doing some financial calculations in his head, probably
                budgeting the
                marriage and reception expenses.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>What have I done? Damn! I should not have told them anything. Idiot! Idiot!
                    Idiot!</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay, I got to go now. I am getting late. I love you both” I concluded.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“We love you and miss you <em>moné</em>”, they said in unison before disconnecting the
                call.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was time for me to leave, but instead of walking to a metro stop, I took a Mobike
                that was
                illegally parked in the community. I was at the metro stop in less than five minutes, thanks to some
                crazy
                biking.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The train towards Lujiazui was neither crowded nor empty, but I saw a drunk guy
                vomiting in the
                corner. As I made way to the next car, the comment from Alice about me not owning a car somehow came
                back to me,
                and I realised that I should be thinking of getting a car, especially if I am going to be serious about
                Jade. We
                can travel to nearby cities in the weekend or just got for long drives when we are bored, which means
                sitting in
                Shanghai traffic for an hour praying to all 330 million Hindu Gods that some idiot doesn’t ding my new
                car.
                Though getting a Shanghai licence plate was next to impossible, I have friends who can help me to get
                licence
                plates from nearby cities like, Suzhou or Nanjing or maybe get one of those electric vehicles for which
                the
                licence plate is nearly free. This would allow us to drive around in Pudong where I worked and take
                weekend
                trips to nearby cities.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The company I worked for offered interest-free loans for up to thirty-six months and a
                monthly
                pre-tax allowance of RMB 1200. That is, if I buy the car from the company’s automotive partner, for some
                models,
                the company offered an assistance of up to 15% for certain small and midsized models. I already started
                thinking
                about some of the models that would be suitable for a long drive which was available in the hybrid
                version too
                since, again, the licence plate was free. I had already converted my Indian driving licence to Chinese
                licence a
                few months back, so I was covered from that point. I should probably check with the HR or Finance the
                process of
                buying the car and applying for the loan. The fact that I was planning my future should have been the
                biggest
                indicator that my life had changed forever.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The train reached the Lujiazui station, and I got off the train and turned right to get
                on to
                the escalator. I saw Jade facing me with her lips parted in surprise. She was on the same train but two
                cars in
                front of mine, so she had to turn left to get on to the escalator, and that when we saw each other. That
                instant, everything else disappeared and I could only see Jade. Like two powerful magnets drawn to each
                other,
                we started walking towards each other, quite unconscious of our surrounding. We were back in our
                parallel
                universe, where only two of us existed. One moment we were separated, the next moment Jade was throwing
                herself
                into my arms, and the next moment, we were kissing each other. If I were to place an exact time where I
                knew,
                that it was going to be difficult to separate us, it was that moment on the platform, although I didn’t
                want to
                admit this. It was just like being in a movie.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Thankfully, sanity prevailed and we left the metro station, hand in hand. We exited the
                metro
                station and used the circular footbridge to cross over to the mall, behind which was located the TGI
                Friday’s.
                The walk was a pleasant one, even though the overbridge had more than its share of tourists trying to
                take
                photos with the Oriental Pearl Tower in the background.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we were walking by the mall towards the restaurant, I realised I had forgotten to
                book
                tables there, but I was confident that being Sunday, we shouldn’t have any issues finding a table.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I have booked a table”, Jade said reading my mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Don’t do that! That’s so creepy. Am I so readable?” I asked acting dejected.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, my dear Anand, you are very readable”, she said laughing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Then my darling Jade… Why are you not reading the fact that I want to make love to you
                right
                now?” I asked with a raised eyebrow and a smirk on my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I read it alright, you pervert. I want you to earn it tonight”, she said with a wink.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Ah, so it’s going to be like that. Let’s see who needs to earn what my darling”, I
                said
                returning the wink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She smiled a secretive smile that conveyed more than any words she could have said. It
                was more
                than just sexual attraction I felt from her; it felt like she genuinely liked me and I have to admit
                that this
                exactly how I felt about Jade… Sometimes you just know it. After a long time, it felt like the universe
                had
                given me someone I could trust. My heart skipped a beat at that thought, and as we walked hand in hand,
                I
                decided that I want to give it a shot, to hell with thinking for three weeks, but I was still not sure
                if this
                is just an infatuation driven by my desire for her or if I genuinely liked her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I looked at Jade walking beside me, looking thoughtful. What was she thinking? Was she
                having
                second thoughts? She didn’t look conflicted, she just looked thoughtful.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand,” she said, “I want you to know that what happened yesterday means a lot to me
                and I
                didn’t do it to force a decision from you. I wanted it to happen because I like you a lot and want to
                know how
                it would feel. No matter what you decide, nothing will change what I feel for you.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She had stopped walking and so had I. I could see the earnestness and fear in her eyes.
                I was
                overcome with this huge sense of empathy and for a second, then and there, I thought I understand what
                she felt.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Jade, I understand what you are trying to say. I like you so much that I fear that…”,
                I
                blurted out and I just about managed to stop myself from saying “I fear that I’m falling in love with
                you” and
                instead finish by telling “…I fear that… this could just be an infatuation and I might end up hurting
                you. I
                have always liked you. These three weeks will help me understand how much of this is just desire and how
                much of
                it is true affection for you. I want you to know this, I have this huge yearning to tell you that I want
                to give
                us a shot, but I don’t want to fuck things up.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This came out fast and Jade seemed surprised at my display of emotions. I could see the
                surprise turn to happiness and she expressed that happiness with a quick kiss on my cheeks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We continued walking hand in hand towards TGI Fridays. I had a smile on my face as I
                was happy
                to get my thoughts out of my system. I can enjoy my dinner in peace. I wanted to know how Jade felt and
                looked
                at her and saw that she had a placid smile on her face, which told me volumes of how she felt at that
                moment.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">It has been a long time since I have lived in the moment. I had spent most of my time
                worrying
                about the future or regretting my past. When I was with Jade, I lived in the moment and never thought
                about the
                future. Of course, when I am not with her, I did fantasise about a future, but it was focussed on the
                good
                things and was not driven by fears or regrets.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We reached TGI Friday’s and waited to be seated. It took the restaurant manager a
                couple of
                minutes to locate Jade’s reservation. As we waited, my phone buzzed a couple of times reminding me, that
                I had
                to put my phone on Do Not Disturb.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I took out the phone and saw that it was a WeChat message was from Nicole. From what I
                could
                see on the preview on the screen, that she had an emergency, that she wanted to change the time for our
                meeting
                and that she would let me know when she can meet, at a later time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I felt a bit let down for a second, but I was too happy at that point to even reply to
                the
                message. I put the phone into Do Not Disturb mode and put it back into my pocket. <em>I can deal with
                    this
                    later.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">We were seated at a table away from the door and away from the bar, an ideal spot for
                us to
                talk. TGI Friday’s in Shanghai generally is the ideal quiet spot for people to have a quiet dinner or a
                quiet
                drink. We probably got the quietest spot there. As I took off my jacket I noticed what Jade was wearing.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade was dressed in a simple white silk blouse and a pair of woollen jeans. The jacket
                she was
                wearing was the same as the previous day. She had a simple make up of lipstick, a bit of blush and
                eye-liner.
                She looked fabulous. She had gracefully removed her jacket and I noticed that the first button of her
                blouse was
                open. I could see a chain with a heart-shaped pendant through the open blouse resting on her chest. She
                folded
                her jacket and placed it next to her handbag. I placed the jacket on the back of my chair.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both sat down and I could see the smooth cleavage of her ample breasts. The memory
                of the
                previous night came rushing back to me and I was reminded of the feeling of her skin upon my skin.
                Before my
                imagination started running wild, a waitress got us the food menu and drinks menu and left us to decide
                what we
                will have for the dinner. She cheerfully introduced herself and reminded us that the happy hour is on
                until 8:00
                PM and all drinks except for wines were on a buy-one-get-one deal.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I waited for Jade to order. She was studying the menu with great interest, which sort
                of meant
                that she was probably not used to the menu, which in turn meant she did not come here too often… Or, she
                was
                trying to be polite.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hmm…” she said while perusing the drinks section of the menu, “I think I will have a
                mojito
                today. What about you?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I think I will have the Bloody Mary”, I replied. I wanted something different, now
                that my
                life is taking a turn at this point.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“That’s quite a deviation from the gin martini”, she said cheekily with a wink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Well, since you are willing to be adventurous and go with the mojito, I should try
                something
                different, right?” I replied without missing a beat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She found my response funny and we shared a moment of laughter, before turning our
                attention to
                the food menu.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>She SHOULD really like me to laugh for that one</em>, I thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We debated what would be a good starter and finally settled for a three in one platter
                and dish
                of baked potato skins. She wanted the chicken pasta and I decided that a medium done cheeseburger minus
                the
                onions and tomatoes, with a side of fries, looked good. We placed the order with a passing waitress and
                requested for two glasses of water while we waited. The waiter returned with two glasses of water and
                left to
                take care of other customers.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade’s phone vibrated and she glanced down at it. I couldn’t read her expression, but
                she was
                smiling. She picked it up, typed out a quick message and locked it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry, it was something I was expecting for some time now. I needed to respond to
                that”, she
                said apologetically and quickly added, “It’s on ‘Do Not Disturb’ now.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s okay, we live in a hyper-connected world, and that comes with its own advantages
                and
                disadvantages”, I dismissed her apology with a wave of my hand.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I know, I have already muted my Facebook and Instagram notifications and I still get
                far too
                many notifications… Stuff I just can’t turn off”, she said in agreement. She had a distant look on her
                face as
                if she was trying to remember what all apps she had in her life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yeah, I have turned off notification for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram and still…
                I get
                enough to disrupt my normal life. I am on ‘Do Not Disturb’ during my work hours” I said, sharing her
                frustration.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We spent the next five minutes complaining about how our lives have been disrupted from
                being
                always connected. We ended the conversation by connecting on Facebook and Instagram. The drink arrived
                right
                about then.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Other than the fact that celery stalk in Bloody Mary was replaced with two long pieces
                of
                sliced celery, the drink was perfect. Jade’s mojito looked okay from my angle. We clinked our glasses
                and took
                the first sip of our drinks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, tell me a little bit about Palermo. I have read a bit about it on the internet,
                but I have
                not travelled around Europe, other than seeing a tiny bit of Eastern Europe”, I inquired as put down the
                glass.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I guess I know as much about Palermo as you do”, she said putting down the glass.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I guess the surprise on my face was apparent, so Jade continued, “I was there in Italy
                when I
                was quite young. This was before my parents separated and got divorced, and my mother came back to
                China. I only
                remember the chapels and cathedrals… and the sea. Even though I have travelled a lot to Europe for work,
                I avoid
                going to Italy as it brings up the memories of my Papa, whom I have not seen in 25 years”. She was
                trying to
                remember details from over 25 years ago, and she didn’t look too happy with those memories.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry, I… I didn’t mean to bring up those memories”, I stammered apologetically.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She stared at me for what felt like an eternity before saying, “It is okay Anand. You
                know very
                little about my past”. She paused to stir the drink and take a sip from it, and added, “Let the past be
                the
                past. I should look forward to my future.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I felt something squeezing my heart when she said ‘my future’ rather than ‘our future’.
                Yes… I
                understood the stupidity behind hoping for something serious just because we had sex, but to me, it
                meant
                something more and I was hoping it meant more to her. I took a sip of the drink to push the thought out
                of my
                head; after all the ball is in my court and I have not yet said ‘yes’ to her “proposal”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey Anand, don’t think about this. So, tell me… How are your parents doing now? And
                how’s your
                sister and brother doing?” she asked breaking my thoughts and bring me back to reality.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The squeeze on my heart was back at the mention of my brother and this time it was
                clear on my
                face. My eyes misted up and it was hard to hide my flaring nostrils. <em>Fuck! That hurts.</em> I tried
                to
                recover, but I was a little too slow. There is only so much you can pretend sometimes and I was not sure
                if I
                wanted to express my emotions in front of Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What happened, Anand? Are you okay?” she asked, surprised at my reaction. When I
                didn’t say
                anything, she added softly, “Listen, whatever it is, I am sorry. Let us not talk about it.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I realised abruptly that I cannot always say I don’t want to talk about something just
                because
                I don’t like it. Perhaps it might be okay to be open for a change and see what happens. I took a large
                sip of
                the drink and cleared my throat before I could start speaking.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“No, it is okay”, I said putting down the drink, “You had no way of knowing...” My
                voice
                cracked a bit and I had to clear my throat again and take another large sip of the drink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She waited patiently as I collected myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You had no way of knowing that… my brother passed away five years back, in an
                accident”, My
                voice was cracking again, and I hated myself for being so emotional.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could hear Jade breathe in sharply at my response. She looked shocked and her face
                had a look
                of horror all over it. Her eyes started brimming with tears and her cheeks had flushed red. She was
                moved. She
                reached across the table and placed her left hand on my right hand, before whispering hoarsely, “Anand,
                I had no
                idea. I am so sorry for your loss. You should have told me when this happened.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I should have told you, but we were no longer in touch and quite honestly, I haven’t
                told many
                people about it. It is still a very painful thing for me, and my family”, I said fighting back my tears
                and
                swallowing the huge lump in my throat. Jade made no effort to stop the tears that were flowing freely
                over her
                flushed cheeks. She was leaning across the table, holding my hands and was weeping quietly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was not sure how much I should tell her, but since she was crying, and I was on the
                verge of
                crying myself, I decided that things couldn’t get any worse. I explained what had happened to my younger
                brother
                and how we lost him in a motorbike accident in Bangalore when he was just twenty-five years old. She
                still had
                tears rolling down her face at the end of my account and I didn’t want to stop her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Usually, I would be conscious of my surroundings and would have tried to console her,
                so that
                she would stop crying and so that I wouldn’t be embarrassed. In this case, I didn’t care. She had lifted
                my hand
                and kissed it gently as the tears continued to flow from her eyes. After about a minute or so, I grabbed
                a
                napkin and starting dabbing off the tears off her cheeks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After a few seconds, she gently let go of my hand and took the napkin from my hand,
                whispered
                an apology and quickly wiped off the tears. She took a few breaths and regained control of herself. I
                didn’t
                like her being sad and I didn’t want her to leave to Italy this way. I took a few deep breaths and
                regained
                control over myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade was looking at me and it looked like she wanted to say something, but at that
                moment the
                waiter arrived with our starter platters. He served us and left us. If he noticed that Jade was crying
                and my
                eyes were moist, he simply ignored it. I had sort of lost my appetite, and by the way, Jade ignored the
                food, it
                looked like she was not too hungry as well. Not even the delicious smell of potato skins or the sight of
                molten
                cheese helped.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We continued to sip our drinks quietly and soon the food arrived. The sight of our food
                failed
                to reignite the appetite. This date was an unmitigated disaster by all accounts and I was not doing
                anything to
                change it. Our drinks were nearly done and I decided to wait before ordering our next round of drinks.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“This date is not going well”, I said with an exaggerated sigh in an attempt to lighten
                the
                mood.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nothing could be further from the truth. You don’t have to assume that date is all
                about happy
                discussion. I feel closer to you, as you were willing to talk about something painful to you and you
                trusted me
                enough to share this with me”, she said, sounding very surprised and very genuine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Really!” it was my turn to be surprised, “I thought I had fucked it up.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, you are a strange guy. You think that I will judge you for every small thing
                that
                happened. How superficial do you think I am”, she said chiding me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry, I can be an idiot sometimes”, I said apologetically trying hard to hide my
                embarrassment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She smiled at my comment and said cheekily with a pout on her face, “God, Anand, let's
                agree
                not to talk about our pasts anymore… At least not now. Can we please start eating or are you going to
                make me
                earn my food as well?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both laughed at her reference to our earlier conversation on our way to the
                restaurant. So,
                even though we had a rocky start, I felt that we were back on track. We started eating our food. I
                helped myself
                to the potato skins and some fried chicken from the platter, and like that, I felt my appetite coming
                back. By
                the way Jade dug into her pasta, it seems her appetite was back too.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Lesson learnt – A delicious meal can sometimes cure the most severe of heartaches, for
                everything else, you have mindless sex (I might be misquoting a famous slogan from a famous brand that
                couldn’t
                make it in China).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We ordered our next round of drinks and politely ignored the waitress’ reminder to
                order more
                drinks before the happy hour ended, as Jade had to fly out the next day, and I wanted to ensure that she
                didn’t
                miss her flight. That reminded me that I didn’t know when she was flying out of Shanghai.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Is it safe to ask you, what time is your flight tomorrow?” I asked half
                tongue-in-cheek and
                half serious; you never know what might trigger off another incident or bad memory.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She put down her fork with a look of shock on her face and a few moments later, started
                laughing. I sort of felt stupid and happy at the same time; stupid because I was being too careful, and
                happy
                because her whole face had light up and that moment, she looked happy and carefree.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You are so cute, Anand”, she said after she recovered. “Of course, it’s okay to ask me
                what
                time my flight is. I am flying out at 10 AM from Pudong Airport. I will go back to my grandparents’
                house
                tonight and I will leave with my grandparents and mom in the morning. All my stuff is already there.”
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The first thought that came to my mind was, <em>So, no sex tonight.</em> I immediately
                felt
                guilty that this was the first thought that came to my mind. I had to redeem myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I looked at my watch as if to confirm the time and said, “That’s early. We should try
                and
                finish up as early as possible so that you can get some rest before flying out tomorrow.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A smile played on her lips when I said this, and she responded with a slight nod of her
                head.
                Well, that’s that then.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She continued to eat her pasta and helped herself to some fries from my plate, without
                asking
                me of course. The burger was fabulous and by the second bite, my appetite was completely back. Jade
                seemed to
                like the pasta as well. I had forgotten to ask her where her grandparents’ house was, but I had a faint
                memory
                that it was in Pudong itself close to where she was living now.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We didn’t speak much during the time we ate, and then it hit me that for women to be
                with
                someone like me, they need to be very understanding. Except for the occasional flashes of creativity, I
                am the
                most boring person out there and I never made an effort to change that. Just not that social or
                sociable, in my
                own honest opinion. I am not well travelled enough that I can talk about places or cuisines
                authoritatively.
                Except for my line of work, or a few things that interest me, I didn’t care about other’s work or life.
                For
                example, I honestly had very little idea what a financial controller was and didn’t make an effort to
                understand
                it for understanding Jade better.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was suddenly gripped by this fear that I might not go far with Jade and I broke into
                a cold
                sweat, which Jade noticed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You suddenly look all sweaty and ill at ease. Is everything okay?” she asked me, as I
                made a
                mental note to do some research and understand what a financial controller is.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh… I’m good. I just think what a financial controller does and remembered how badly I
                sucked
                in Accounting and Finance during my MBA. Just the thought of Accounting and Finance courses scared the
                living
                crap out of me”, I lied with a smiling face. It’s true… I sucked at Accounting and finance so bad that
                when I
                got a B+, I celebrated with my friends. This believable lie, which was also a fun fact, elicited another
                laugher
                from Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I said earlier that she looked pleasing to the eyes, but now I stand corrected, she
                looked
                stunningly beautiful. Her eyes were shining with delight and I almost fell in love with her at that
                moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I like it very, very much when you smile and laugh”, I said as her laughter subsided.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I love it that you make me laugh”, she said with a smile playing on her lips. My heart
                skipped
                a beat at the mention of the word “love”. The way she smiled did not help with what I was feeling for
                her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We drank to that and quietly continued with our dinner.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade finally, finished her dinner first and pushed the plate. I had decimated the
                burger in
                about ten minutes and was nibbling on the fries trying to keep her company, so I was relieved when she
                finally
                finished her dinner. I was truly full and I couldn’t eat another bite. We still had a lot of food
                leftover.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We both looked at the remaining food and each other and instantly knew that we were
                thinking
                the same thing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Doggy bag”, we both said at the same time and laughed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We called the waitress and asked her for the check and to package or <em>da bao</em>
                the
                remaining food. Jade insisted that she should pay the bill, as I had high-jacked the bill for the drinks
                last
                night (or early morning depending on how one looked at it). We haggled around for ten minutes as to who
                should
                pay for the dinner, the waitress patiently waited with the POS machine in her hand. I grudgingly allowed
                Jade to
                make the payment as she showed no sign of relenting and it was close to 8:00 PM now and we still had to
                finish
                our drinks. Looks like the condoms in my jacket pocket will remain unused, and that was good in this
                case.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Jade made payment using Alipay, the realisation hit me that I should be trying to
                form some
                good memories with her instead of trying to get her into bed. Any emotional connection that we will form
                now
                will go further than any physical relationship we may share at this point. Love and lust tend to be
                temporary,
                and once all that is exhausted, what remains in the relationship is trust and respect. This was
                something I have
                learnt the hard way. If I were to have a relationship with Jade, I need to accept the reality that I am
                indeed
                starting this relationship based on lust and some memories of the time we shared. Jade seemed to trust
                me, and
                that’s perhaps the reason why she was willing to try having a relationship with me. I should try to
                repay in
                kind. As much as I may miss her and wanted her, I needed her to remember me as a gentleman who respects
                her for
                the person she is and as someone who can be trusted.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Jade, let us finish our drinks, and get out of here. I want to take you to the bund”,
                I said
                as the waitress left us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This perhaps caught her off guard, as she seemed surprised. She was possibly expecting
                me to be
                thinking of ways to get her to sleep with me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You see, you need to fly out tomorrow and I was thinking that… you should get proper
                rest
                before flying out”, I paused to take a drink and added, “Let’s take a walk on the bund and then let me
                drop you
                back home.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You do the most unexpected things, Anand. I would love to take a walk with you and I
                would
                love it if you can drop me back home”, she said with a thoughtful and slightly surprised smile. I could
                see the
                admiration in her eyes and perhaps some love. She would have been assuming all along that I was doing
                everything
                possible to get her into bed, but then here I was holding back the most primal of instincts and showing
                her that
                I cared for her as a person.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Intimacy is a tricky subject and in this materialistic, scorekeeping, book balancing
                world we
                live in, there is a tendency amongst some to believe that every action is a selfish act done to get
                something in
                return. It could be a gift, a conversation over dinner or drink, or, a romp in the bed. Intimacy becomes
                deal
                based and transactional; you end up keeping account of your actions and what you got in return. You make
                a note
                of the size and generosity of the transaction and ensure that you do everything to ensure that you are
                not in a
                debt – from the point of, either the size of the gift or the generosity of the action.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">For Jade, I was done keeping the book, here is a person for whom I didn’t want to do
                that.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am done with my drink, I am ready to leave when you are”, I said pushing away the
                glass.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am done too. Let’s go”, she said.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She got up, put on her jacket and picked up her purse. I got up, put on my jacket and
                said,
                “Let’s go.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade walked to my side and linked her arms with mine and we walked out of the
                restaurant. As
                usual, one of the waitresses thanked us for our patronage on our way out.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We walked up to the promenade and started strolling along the bund. It was a clear,
                chilly
                night and we could see the beautiful lights on the west side of the river or the older Shanghai. Pudong
                might be
                all new and fancy, but if one truly wants to experience Shanghai he or she should live in Puxi. You will
                get to
                enjoy all the aspects, good and bad, of Shanghai life. We could also see a few cruise ships make its way
                up the
                river and few barges going up and down the river. There was a light breeze blowing over the river and it
                ruffled
                the surface of the Huangpu River giving the reflections on the river life of its own.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It’s really beautiful here”, said Jade voicing my thought. I nodded my head in
                agreement and
                we continued our walk. We occasionally stole glances at each other and now we were holding hands with
                fingers
                intertwined. A sudden gust of wind ruffled Jade’s hair and I could see that she was feeling cold, as she
                hugged
                herself for some warmth. I removed my jacket and draped it over her shoulders.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I draped the jacket over her shoulders, our eyes locked for a moment and we could
                see how
                much we desired each other. I leaned in and kissed her on her lips. The moment our lips touches Jade’s
                arms were
                around me. I pulled her closer into my arms and kissed her deeply. We were unaware of what was happening
                around
                us and we didn’t care. We finally broke the kiss and stood there holding each other tightly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes”, I said.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“What?” she sounded confused.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes, I want to give us a shot. Jade, my darling, I like you so much that I don’t want
                to wait
                three weeks”, I said clarifying what I meant. I was surprised that I found the courage to say out loud
                what I
                was thinking.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, what did you just say?” Jade asked me breathlessly in a small voice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were so many emotions on her face and in her voice, that I was afraid that I
                might have
                fucked it up. Since I might have fucked it up I repeated, “I said ‘I want to give us a shot’”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, are you sure? Because I cannot stand a heartbreak when it comes to you. So,
                again, are
                you sure? Do you want some more time to decide where we need to go from here?” she asked me, her eyes
                wide and
                voice slightly breathless. She was still holding on to me and she was pressed against me, her whole body
                tensed
                up like a piano wire. Our face was less than an inch apart and I could see her eyes searching my face
                trying to
                read me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Yes darling, I want us to be together. I like everything about you and I am sure that
                I want
                to give our relationship a shot”, I said with a smile on my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could see tears of joy filling up in her eyes as she hugged me close and whispered
                what
                sounded like, “Thank you”. I cradled her head against my chest and kissed her hair.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We stood there holding each other and my heart was filled with joy. I knew that I was
                going to
                be very happy with Jade and I wanted to make her happy. We finally let go of each other.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You just made me very happy Anand”, she said in a voice trembling with emotion.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I kissed her gently on her lips and said, “I am happy that I could make you happy. I
                have
                always liked you, Jade. I wanted you to know this before you left for Italy.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We hugged again briefly, before resuming our walk. We walked hand in hand, with Jade
                leaning on
                my shoulders, until the end of the promenade. We stood by the huge anchor, soaking in the view on the
                other side
                and when I looked at Jade, she had a smile on her face and she looked joyous.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She suddenly turned to me and said, “Please don’t change your mind. Please wait for me
                to come
                back.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I will not change my mind and I am already wishing that these three weeks goes by
                quickly”, I
                said in an assuring and assertive tone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Can we take a photo together? I don’t want to miss you when I’m in Italy”, Jade
                explained.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">While I detest having my photo taken, I couldn’t refuse her. She took out her phone,
                open the
                camera app and put it in selfie mode. She drew closer to me and with the Puxi side of the bund in the
                background, took five or six photos with various expressions. The final one was of us kissing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She broke the kiss and said, “Let’s go back home, you should be freezing.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We started walking back to the beginning of the promenade. She wanted to give me back
                my
                jacket, but I refused as I could see that she was cold. My tolerance for cold was better when I am with
                beautiful women. I made a mental note to ask her to airdrop photos to me when we are on our way back
                home.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we reached the intersection of Fucheng road and West Lujiazui road, I took out my
                phone and
                opened the Didi app to order a ride for us (of course I ignored the message that was now piled up in the
                notification tray), when I realised that I didn’t know where exactly Jade’s grandparents’ house was. I
                asked her
                for the address to which she responded by taking the phone from me and typed out the address into the
                search
                box. I took the phone back and tapped the ride request button. I had remembered correctly as the house
                was
                indeed close to where Jade lived and was one of those newer high-rise apartments. If my memory served me
                right,
                those apartments were upwards of twenty million RMB and that realisation reflected on my face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I used some of my inheritance and bought one of the smaller apartments there for my
                mother”,
                she admitted hesitantly seeing the expression on my face. She was blushing in embarrassment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I see”, I said not knowing what else to say. On one hand, I was happy that Jade has
                not
                changed much since she inherited the wealth from her father, but on the other hand, my insecurities were
                rearing
                their ugly heads.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tapped the ‘ride-hail’ button as I tried to push my insecurities out of my mind. She
                knows
                about my family background and she knew that I came from an Indian middle-class family. This was a
                non-factor
                for her, as I know that she was also interested in me as a person, at least that’s what the optimist in
                me was
                telling myself. This thought made me smile and my smile made Jade smile in relief.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A driver accepted my ride and he called to confirm my location. As we waited for the
                ride at
                the intersection, I lit up a cigarette and offered it to Jade. She took it with a smile and started
                smoking. I
                lit another one and inhaled on it. It didn’t feel disgusting; I guess until I talked to Jade and got my
                thoughts
                out, I just didn’t feel good about things I usually to do. We quietly enjoyed the smoke in each other’s
                presence
                and to me, it was as good as the smoke we shared after having the pancakes Jade made for me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I used this opportunity to ask Jade to airdrop the photos to me. She seemed to know
                what
                airdrop was, as she asked me to turn on the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the phone, which I did then and
                there. She
                selected all the photos we took together and shared it with my phone. I saved the photos on to my phone
                and
                couldn’t help but flip through the photos we had taken together.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The ride arrived about five minutes later and we stubbed out the cigarettes and got
                into the
                car. I got in with Jade and closed the door which I had held open for her. The driver confirmed the ride
                start
                and we set off towards Jade’s apartment. I requested the driver to drop me back home after dropping Jade
                back
                home, and he agreed to my request readily.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We sat close to each other and Jade leaned on my shoulder with eyes closed. As we
                headed down
                Century Avenue towards Jade’s grandparent’s home, I gently kissed her forehead and I could make out a
                smile of
                satisfaction playing on her lips.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This date might not have started well, but in the end, it worked out okay and we both
                were
                happy. I was certain that we had something to look forward to.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 19. Fast Forward and Rewind</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I was sitting in outside Starbucks by the bund. A gust of wind blew a strand of my now
                long
                hair over my eyes and gently grazed my nose. I brushed back the long and slightly greasy strand out of
                my face.
                My sunglasses ensured that the hair didn’t get into my eyes. I took a sip of the hot black coffee and
                wiped the
                coffee out my scraggly moustache with the back of my hand.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Everyone else around me felt and made it obvious that I badly needed a haircut and
                shave, but
                for some reason, I didn’t feel the same even though my hair had grown to shoulder length, and my beard
                was now
                very long and very unkept. I brushed my teeth every day, showered every day, shampooed my hair & beard,
                changed
                underwear every day, and wore clean clothes, which in my opinion was enough grooming.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The hangover was an intense one this time, and the coffee was barely helping. I was
                truly
                grateful that this was a weekend and not a weekday. It was time for a smoke. I lit up a cigarette,
                inhaled deep
                and started coughing violently almost immediately. I could taste the blood in my phlegm which I had
                coughed up.
                I looked around to ensure that no one was looking at me, spat out the phlegm into a rolled-up tissue and
                placed
                it into an empty cup left behind by another customer. My doctor had asked me to quit smoking since my
                mild
                asthma had aggravated to pneumonia, but I was obstinate about not quitting. I just continued to smoke
                and
                continued to take medication to “counter” the effects of smoking, which was, of course, stupid, but then
                so-called “love” makes some of us stupid and irrational.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Six months had passed since Jade left for Italy. Four months had passed since I
                discovered the
                truth. Since that day, I have been falling lower and lower with no bottom in sight.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was a beautiful day, and there were many couples and families out to enjoy the sun
                and the
                view. As was expected, there were a lot of tourists, enjoying the view on the bund and snapping pictures
                in
                various poses. There was a lot of happiness and laughter in the air, and there were a lot of happy kids
                running
                around.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All this happiness… It reminded me of my foolish happiness and the life I imagined with
                Jade.
                It just made me sick, and I had to get out of there. I stubbed out the cigarette and got up to leave.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I stood up to leave, I felt woozy for a second and everything started blacking out.
                Just as
                I started losing my consciousness, I remembered that I had not eaten properly for four days now. I fell
                back
                heavily into the chair I was seated and pass out. The last thought in my head before losing my
                consciousness
                was, <em>I’m so fucked up</em>.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>I woke up into inky blackness. There was no up and down; there was no left and
                    right; there
                    was nothing, and I was suspended in the pitch-black blackness.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>The blackness had engulfed me and it felt as if I was floating through space if
                    that space
                    was made of tar. This blackness penetrated every single pore and cell in my body. It was icy cold,
                    suffocating blackness which paralysed my whole body and I couldn’t move an inch. I struggled to
                    breathe and
                    break free, but the darkness had held me captive in its vice-like grip.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Some primal part of my brain screamed at me to wake up, but my eyes were sealed
                    shut. The
                    blackness had seeped into my lungs and I was struggling to breathe. My lungs were paralysed and
                    failed to
                    respond to the most basic commands from the sub-conscious mind – Breath! I tried to scream for help
                    and my
                    jaw seemed to be held shut by the blackness. My heart started beating harder and faster in panic and
                    terror.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">This terror was what brought me around, and I snapped awake. I gulped a few deep
                breaths to
                calm my heart down. I felt dizzy from passing out and, felt cold and clammy despite the weather outside
                being
                pleasant. Pneumonia and the asthma were acting up. I took out my inhaler and pumped a couple of doses of
                the
                medicine into my lungs and felt the airways opening up after a few laboured breaths.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It took me a few moments to get my bearings and I realised that I was still at the
                Starbucks by
                the bund. The dream itself didn’t surprise me, as I had this recurring dream for the past three months
                since the
                first asthma attack. As the cloud in my brain further cleared up, I realised that the scene had not
                changed much
                since I passed out. By looking at the position of the sun, and at the time on my phone, I realised that
                I had
                passed out for less than five minutes. It was still joyful, and there were still kids running around –
                generally, under normal circumstances, nothing changes in five minutes, but then your life can change in
                a blink
                of the eye. I started feeling sick at heart again as I was reminded of that painful memory.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew I had to get out of there, but I was starving and was worried that I would pass
                out
                again, this time on the way to the metro station. This would be a disaster as most of the people here
                wouldn’t
                give a shit about a foreigner who has passed out on the footpath and in fact would avoid him or her like
                the
                plague. With that happy thought in my mind, I turned to pick up my bag and head indoors to buy some
                food. You
                may be surprised that my bag was not stolen, but then, given the state of my knapsack, I would be
                surprised if
                the bag was stolen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The bag was over eight years old – very faded and very frayed. Despite the best efforts
                to
                clean the bag, it was covered with remnants of various stains accumulated over these years. In summary,
                it
                looked like something that came out of a garbage can or a landfill or something that the Salvation Army
                rejected. Combined with my dishevelled and nearly homeless look, even the most desperate of thief would
                have had
                serious second or third thoughts about stealing the bag. It just wasn’t worth their effort.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I joined the queue at the Starbucks and ignored the stares of some of the people around
                me who
                were wondering how a homeless Indian or Pakistani guy ended up in China or something along those lines.
                I must
                have slipped through the visa and immigration gaps.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The people in front of me and behind me moved away from me and wrinkled their nose in
                disgust.
                I knew they were imagining smell emanating from my body, and I knew it was just their imagination. I had
                showered in the morning and had applied enough deodorant and perfumes in the morning to last me the
                whole day. I
                didn’t care much as this perception effect helped me get seats in metro and helped cleared tables at
                coffee
                shops.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I ordered in Chinese, which shocked the cashier and people behind me. I could hear a
                murmur of
                how good my Chinese sounded for a homeless-looking Arab. I ordered a croissant, a coconut & hazelnut
                scone, and
                a cup of double-shot latte. I paid with my Alipay app and requested the croissant and the scone to be
                warmed up.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I waited for my order to be ready, I grabbed a few packets of sugar from the nearby
                counter,
                ripped open one of the packets and poured sugar into my mouth to ensure that I don’t pass out again.
                This
                further attracted some glares of disdain from the patrons in the café. I wanted to show my middle finger
                to the
                people who thought they can judge me by my appearances and behaviours, but I made the effort to ignore
                these
                people and succeeded.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After about five minutes the order was ready and I took the food out back to where I
                was
                sitting. The waiter had cleared out the cup I had left behind and replaced ashtray with a fresh one. I
                moved
                back to “my” now clean table. As I sat down in the seat I was seated before… the seat in which I had
                passed out,
                I realised that my table was the last available table.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I started having the first decent meal in four days, not considering the booze and
                snacks I had
                ingested during those four days. I added a packet of brown sugar to my coffee and stirred it until I was
                certain
                that the sugar had dissolved. I took a bite of the warm buttery croissant, and it was then I realised
                how hungry
                I was. The croissant disappeared in less than a minute and I washed it down with the warm coffee.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I sat there enjoying the sensation that was washing over my body… It was like having an
                orgasm,
                only better; the pleasure sensation was not localised and I felt my whole body come back to life. I
                wanted to
                smoke a cigarette but the pain in my chest told me I should hold off for some more time. I was just
                about to
                attack the scone when I felt someone standing in front of me. I say “felt” as I didn’t initially see who
                it was
                – I was so focused on my scone that I didn’t see anything else around me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I raised my head to see a familiar face staring down at me. It was Nicole Zhang,
                standing there
                with a cup of coffee. But, there were no signs of recognition on her face, which was understandable as
                my
                appearances had changed drastically since we had last met. My jaw dropped open.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One might think that in a city teeming with 24 million people, such encounters should
                be rare,
                and nearly impossible. But, since most of us live a life of fixed routine and most of us have fixed
                preferences
                for the places we like to visit, it is not that unimaginable that our paths should intersect more often
                than one
                would imagine.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">At least once a week, I would recognise a stranger during the metro ride to my office
                or would
                see a familiar face on my walk between metro and office. Now, some of you might say that all Chinese
                people look
                somewhat similar, but having lived in Shanghai long enough, I would first call you racist and then go on
                to tell
                you that I can differentiate most of the features. Once every while, I would see people I recognise in
                the metro
                even on weekends, given that I liked to go to bund or <em>Huaihai</em> road or the <em>Jing’An</em> Area
                and it
                was entirely possible that these people also like to hang out in the same area. We live in a world of
                familiar
                strangers. The funny thing is, over the years I have stayed in China, I have come to believe that more
                strangers
                recognise me than I recognise them.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Excuse me for interrupting”, she said in her slightly accented English, “But, all the
                other
                seats are taken” She gestured around to bring to my attention, the fact that almost all the seats,
                except the
                ones at my table, were taken.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“If this place is not taken, and if you don’t mind, may I sit here?” she added
                politely, still
                not recognising me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I clear my throat, and said, “Sure” as I nodded my head.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was hoping that my voice might jog her memory, but no such luck. But then, all the
                smoking
                and the multiple bouts of pneumonia has changed my voice to be scratchier and deeper tone than before,
                so
                expecting her to recognise my voice was a bit of a stretch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Thank you”, she replied with a polite smile and sat down gracefully. She placed the
                coffee on
                the table, sat down and fished out her MacBook Air, an older 11-inch version. She opened the laptop,
                smiled at
                me again, turned to her laptop and went about her business.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I decided to stop staring as clearly, Nicole was nowhere close to recognising me. The
                fact that
                I was wearing sunglasses probably didn’t help in the recognition. I removed my glasses and placed on the
                table,
                hoping that would jog her memory. I blinked my eyes to adjust to the sudden flood of light. She was
                still deeply
                engrossed in whatever she was doing and didn’t even look up towards me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Nicole continued working, I quietly ate the scone and washed it down with some
                coffee. I
                studied the face of the person sitting across me, very carefully. I had to be sure that this is who I
                thought it
                was. It was the same perfect face, with the full lips, the perfect nose, the beautiful oval face, and
                the same
                sparkling black eyes… It was definitely, the one and only, Nicole Zhang… She had hardly changed. Which
                is
                normal, as people who live their normal lives wouldn’t change much in half a year, but for people who
                were going
                through hell, that half-year might be equivalent of half a dozen years.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I honestly believed myself to be in the second category, someone going through living
                hell, but
                the fact that people have stopped recognising me made me question that belief… Then and there. Here is a
                person
                whom I had once believed would never forget me, would be a friend for the rest of my life and she has
                failed to
                recognise me. I had brooded all this while and refused to let go of my past; this has done nothing but
                ruins my
                health. I pushed away from the people closest to me, people who cared about me… People like my parents,
                my
                sister, my large family, my friends like Allen, or even someone like Nicole. Instead, I was trying to
                find an
                outlet for the madness I felt.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was the moment of clarity.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had to make a choice. I can finish the rest of the coffee and the scone, and I can
                leave
                quietly or I can talk to Nicole, remind her that it’s me. I was allowed to start the change then and
                there and
                it was a terrifying feeling. I had lived more or less like a hermit these past few months and I had
                lived the
                way I wanted to live. I had lived these past six months without having to answer to anyone. I had abused
                that
                situation and chose to lock myself in a dark place, unwilling to talk to friends and punishing myself…
                For a
                situation, I couldn’t change. I had gotten comfortable in my little broken world and the decision to
                come out
                that is really hard.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Why fix broken shit, only to be broken again?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The real question was, was I that broken? Or was it just a crack that hurts a lot but
                will heal
                over time? Or is it just that I need to be a little bit more courageous, a little bit more resilient and
                deal
                with shit that happens in life. After all, I had come to the realisation a while back, incidentally
                while
                talking to Nicole, that my pain is possibly nothing compared to the real mental and physical pain people
                go
                through their lives.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I ate the rest of my scone, drank the rest of my coffee and pondered over these
                questions. I
                had a decent job. I can afford to eat three square meals. I have a decent home. I have money to spend on
                clothes
                and footwear. I have chosen to punish myself and for what? For something I thought was my fault? At this
                point,
                I was not sure any more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole had looked up two times during the time I finished my scone, but she still
                failed to
                recognise me. I was done with the scone and nearly done with the coffee as well, and I had made up my
                mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I should finish my coffee and leave. This was the best scenario that I could think of.
                I had no
                explanation for not talking to her all this while when she was seated right opposite to me. I can
                message her
                later.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finished up the coffee, picked up my bag and got up to leave. As I stood up, Nicole
                looked up
                from the laptop and stared straight into my eyes. She smiled and gave me a polite nod. I returned the
                smile and
                the nod, and that instant I thought I saw a flicker of recognition or that of doubt passing over her
                face, but I
                decided not to stay there any further to find out what would happen next.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I started walking to the metro after leaving Starbucks. I lit a cigarette and inhaled
                deeply.
                The pressure on the chest was back immediately and I started coughing violently. I dropped the cigarette
                and
                fished out my inhaler. As I pumped two doses of the medicines into my lungs, I felt my phone vibrate. I
                ignored
                my phone and waited for my lungs to relax, and my breathing to normalise. A minute later I had
                recovered.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Another moment of clarity – I need to quit smoking, so then and there, I decide to quit
                smoking. There were more than a dozen cigarettes left in the packet and an unopened packet in my bag,
                but I knew
                that if I tried to quit after I finished those cigarettes, like the way I had tried before, I most
                probably
                wouldn’t be quitting any time soon. I had to grab this moment and hold on to it… This was quite possibly
                my last
                opportunity to quit smoking and start making changes in my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had made up my mind. I threw away the cigarettes and my favourite jet flame lighter
                into the
                nearest trash-can I could find. I immediately felt a huge weight lift off my mind. It was entirely
                possible that
                the feeling was more psychological than physiological, but for me, the feeling was as real as the
                cigarettes
                that I just threw away.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As the escalator took me up to the footbridge that connected Super Brand Mall to
                Lujiazui metro
                station, my phone vibrated again. I took my phone out of the jeans pocket and unlocked it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were two messages. One from Allen Huang and the other one, the more recent one
                from…
                Nicole Zhang.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I blinked my eyes in disbelief after seeing that the message was from Nicole. For a
                moment, I
                thought I was hallucinating. The very next thought was if she was messaging inform me that she did
                recognise me
                and she was upset with the fact that I didn’t possibly recognise her, or it could be that a wild-looking
                Indian
                guy reminded her of me or…</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Rather than imagining up more scenarios, I tapped the message from Nicole and opened
                it.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hey Anand, how you been? Hope you remember me. Well, I was
                thinking
                about you just now and realised that we have not talked in a while.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was thinking of a response to Nicole message when I got a second message from her.
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): If you are free tomorrow, do you want to meet for a brunch?
                We can
                meet at the Blue Frog or TGI Fridays near the bund.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The mention of the TGI Friday stopped my heart for a moment. The memory of my date with
                Jade
                came rushing back and I started feeling dizzy again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I stopped walking, stood there taking deep breaths and waited for the dizziness to
                pass. After
                the dizziness had passed, surprisingly, I was not feeling angry or sad. While I cannot accurately
                describe the
                feeling, I would say that it felt like acceptance.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hey Nicole, long time no see. Of course, I remember you :-).
                I am
                doing okay. Strangely, I was just thinking about you too. Let’s meet at Blue Frog near the bund
                tomorrow. What
                time would you want to meet?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I waited for a reply from Nicole and entered the Lujiazui metro station. As I got on to
                the
                escalator that led passengers down to the underground metro platform, Nicole’s response came in.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): :-) Are you okay to meet by 11:00?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I replied immediately before she changed her mind.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Sure. 11 Sounds perfect. See you tomorrow :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I got an immediate response from Nicole.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): See you tomorrow :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When I swiped the metro card and entered the metro station, I realised that I was
                smiling, and
                if I were, to be honest with myself, it felt good to start moving forward rather than being obsessed
                with the
                past. It’s not that I have not smiled and laughed all this while, but this one came from a place deep
                within. I
                was afraid of feeling too happy, just to have it smashed to bits later, but still, I enjoyed the feeling
                at that
                moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My train arrived a few moments later, I got into the train and checked the message from
                Allen,
                though I knew it was another invite from him to go over to his place for dinner and drinks. I accepted
                his
                invitation, but this time I genuinely wanted to meet him and Jean, and not just to keep up with the
                appearances.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I guess it is time now to take a step back and connects the dots since Jade left to
                Italy to
                the day at Starbucks. Time to rewind the tape… Time to go back six months so that I can fill in some
                gaps and
                you may understand how everything went downhill for me.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 20. The Day After the Dinner Date</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I woke up feeling refreshed the next day, the day after the dinner date, at around 7:00
                AM,
                even though I had slept only at around 2:00 AM. I guess it had to do with the fact that it was Monday
                and it was
                a holiday. Not working on a Monday is itself a refreshing thought but having had the night I had the
                Monday felt
                even sweeter.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The previous night, I had reached home around half past 8, had taken another cold
                shower and
                changed into my night gear. I had put on a hoodie, stepped out on to the balcony and started smoking a
                cigarette
                to help me think about what I should do.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t want to wait for three weeks until Jade came back, but I didn’t want to look
                desperate
                by committing right away. I tried imagining what would happen if Jade were to change her mind, and it
                was a
                painful thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I would be left in a place where I wouldn’t be able to meet Jade, see her laughter,
                hold her,
                make love to her, share a quiet moment with her, have dinner dates with her, travel around the world
                with her
                and perhaps even spend the rest of my life with Jade. I loved the fact that I was living the moment,
                most of the
                time, whenever I am with Jade. This is something I felt I can do with for the rest of my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The question was, was Jade the right person for me and vice versa. I know her, but then
                how
                well do I know her and vice versa, how well do Jade know me. She had admitted that she used to be
                superficial
                and cared only about money, and If I were, to be honest with myself I was also superficial in the sense,
                I was
                attracted to the beauty of Jade Lin. It was also possible that I was looking for security in the known.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Another thing that was a factor was the fact that I was insecure about my looks and I
                feared
                that I will never find anyone as attractive as Jade. I felt ashamed of this small, selfish, and
                superficial
                thought.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tried to push all these thoughts out of my mind, but they just kept coming back to me
                like a
                bad penny, until these thoughts started going in a circle. This cyclone of thoughts was dissipated by
                the phone
                vibrating in my pocket. I unlocked my phone to find that I had a WeChat message from Jade.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): I hope you reached home, Anand. Thank you for the wonderful
                evening, I
                enjoyed spending time with you. I will miss you when I am away. I will miss holding you and kissing you.
                Please
                wait for me... I will be back before you know it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This message washed away some of my insecurities and my shame, as the message was a
                sign that I
                shouldn’t doubt myself too much and try to live the moment. I took a deep breath and immediately typed
                out a
                response to Jade.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): I am home Jade. I had a great evening too. I will miss you
                too. I
                really meant it when I said that I wanted to give our relationship a shot. I don’t think I can spend a
                day
                without you. Please go to sleep now XOXO.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was hoping that Jade would respond immediately, but instead, I waited about 45
                seconds
                staring the screen looking at the word ‘Typing’, on top of the chat screen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I think my eyes had glazed over as I waited for the response because I felt the message
                before
                I saw it.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Anand, I think... I think I am falling in love with you. I know
                it’s
                too early to for me to say this, but something in my head told me that I should let you know what I
                feel. Please
                don’t think I am pushing you when I say this.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was blown away by this message and nearly dropped my phone. My heart started racing
                at the
                implication of what she said. She said “I love you”, indirectly of course and for people in our age
                group, that
                phrase means a lot. It meant she had very strong feelings for me, or she had some mental problems, but I
                didn’t
                want it to be to the latter.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In any case, I decided to wait for two minutes, just to ensure that Jade wouldn’t
                recall the
                message after realising that she might have committed too early. The two-minute wait turned to a
                five-minute
                wait, just to ensure that she had an opportunity to change her mind. I guess, she was starting to worry
                now
                because, after six minutes, she sent me three messages, one after the other, and I could almost sense
                the panic
                she was feeling.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Anand, are you okay?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Did I say something wrong?</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Did I just screw up even before we got started? I am so
                sorry... I just
                thought you felt the same way as I felt and I was done waiting for you to say it :-(.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This flood of message snapped me into action and I messaged her back.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): No No, nothing like that. I feel the same way and I didn’t
                know how
                to express this to you without seeming like I’m rushing things. I think I am falling in love you too
                Jade. I
                want nothing more than being with you, and possibly spending the rest of my life with you.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, instead of texting back, Jade “Facetimed” me on WeChat. Now, I did mention earlier
                that I
                had some reservations about video chatting on WeChat as a replacement for real human connection, but
                when I saw
                Jade in her nightdress staring at me on that phone screen, I sort of changed my mind and thought, <em>I
                    can make
                    this work for three weeks</em>. She looked stunning and she was glowing with happiness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand”, Jade said, her voice and her face full of emotions, “Did you just tell me what
                you
                want to spend the rest of your life with me?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I hadn’t thought about it that way when I said that I wanted to spend “the rest of my
                life
                with” her, but I knew in my heart this is what I wanted.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I guess, I just did”, I replied, blushing and smiling from ear to ear.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Oh, this is moving too fast,” She mumbled with a distant look on her face. She seemed
                to be
                thinking about what we should do next. She seemed happy and conflicted at the same time. She had that
                look that
                which meant she was about to speak her mind. The smile on my face had faded off and was replaced with a
                frown.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Anand, I would like that as well, but let’s take this one step at a time. I want us to
                know
                the good and bad sides of each other. I don’t want you to be telling me this because I voiced what I
                feel for
                you”, she said after about a minute.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Right now, I know how we feel for each other and this is a great start, but I don’t
                want to
                get into a long-term commitment without experiencing more of the life with you. Right this moment, I
                think that
                I am falling in love with you, I know that. I have learnt the hard way, that being in love for a moment
                is easy,
                but staying in love for weeks, months, years… for the rest of life, which is nearly impossible and takes
                a lot
                of effort and mutual understanding. I want us to build this up… travel together, live together, make
                life
                decisions together and see how best we can tolerate each other”, she added before I could refute her
                earlier
                argument.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I paused a minute and tried to imagine things from her perspective. She had gone
                through a
                nasty divorce and that is the sort of thing that will leave a permanent scar, no matter how courageous
                or strong
                one might be. She would also want to take things slow and understand me as a person a little bit more.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Sure, our chemistry was out of the world and I knew that we liked being with each other
                physically, but that really shouldn’t define the relationships. After all, we live in a society where
                sex is a
                mechanical activity like getting drunk once in a while or going for a weekend trip, but to start a
                relationship
                under the premise and guidance of quality sex was… for the lack of better words, idiotic.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You are right, Jade”, I said, summarising my thoughts, and emphasised, “We should take
                some
                time to think about all the aspects of our lives”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She had a smile on her face and I wished that we were together, even it is for just
                five
                minutes, so that I could hold her and kiss her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I wish that I could be there with you now”, Jade said, voicing my thought for both of
                us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“When will you stop reading my thoughts?” I asked, half-joking, half-serious, and fully
                knowing
                what the response would be.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You know the answer for that”, she replied, with a knowing smile on her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I liked to hear that from you”, I responded, fully knowing that she was playing with
                me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Alright”, she said with an exaggerated sigh, but smiling, “As long as we are together,
                I am
                never going to stop doing that – reading your thoughts.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“And, you better not”, I said, smiling broadly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I heard a lady’s voice in the background asking Jade to go to sleep early. Jade turned
                and
                responded in Chinese, that she will be turning in soon,</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Before she could convey that message to me, I jumped in and said, “Listen, you need to
                get up
                early tomorrow. Please go to sleep now. I will text you in the morning.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She smiled and said, “Yes, I need to sleep now. You please go back to sleep and we can
                talk
                like this once I am in Palermo. I will miss you a lot”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Goodnight darling, Have a safe journey tomorrow. I too will miss you”, I said.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Goodnight, my dear Anand. Take care”, she said before ending the call.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I wanted to sleep immediately, and I went to bed after I smoked another cigarette, but
                for some
                reason, sleep didn’t come that easily. I kept tossing and turning for the next few hours until sleep
                came to me
                around 2 AM. I had this feeling of unease, a sense of foreboding, but I couldn’t put a finger on the
                feeling.
                But, when the sleep finally came to me, I slept a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">So, that was last night.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, Jade should be on the way to the airport with her family or already at the
                airport.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was still in my bed when I checked my phone to see if there were any messages from
                Jade and
                there were indeed two messages from Jade and one message from Nicole.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I opened up the message from Jade, which she has sent in the morning. Nicole’s message
                could
                wait for some time.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Hey Anand, we are on our way to the airport, will be reaching
                soon. I
                didn’t sleep much last night. I was thinking of us the whole night. I almost wanted to come to your home
                and
                spend some time with you. What I am trying to say is, I miss you very much and still think I am falling
                in love
                with you. I want you to take your time and think about what we talked about the last night.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): I will get a local number once I’m in Italy. I will message or
                call on
                WeChat from a Wi-Fi hotspot until then. Take care of yourself, dear.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): PS: We both should smoke less, and drink less.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was sent just two minutes before I woke up. I almost started feeling guilty that I
                slept
                better than Jade. I wanted to lie about sleeping, but after thinking for about five minutes, I knew that
                I
                shouldn’t. I didn’t want to start the relationship based on lies. Experience has shown that it takes the
                relationship nowhere.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We start a relationship based on lies and try to show our best sides to the other
                person
                because we fear that our relationship wouldn’t succeed otherwise. This is probably one of the biggest
                reasons
                relationship fails; people don’t know the truth until they were deep into the relationships and when the
                truth
                comes out, there is a sense of betrayal.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The size of betrayal varies. It might be a something relatively small, like an email
                address
                that the partner didn’t know about or a second phone number that the spouse didn’t know about. It might
                be a
                larger betrayal, like an active Ashley Madison or Tinder profile or other sexual partners or a serious
                drug
                habit or an anger problem that the partner was unaware of. Whatever is the case, all these little and
                big
                betrayals add up, and destroys the relationship, leading to breaks up and nasty divorces.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">But then, I am not an expert on relationships and these were my assumptions based on my
                experiences, as of that moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">So, I replied with the truth.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Good morning darling, I couldn’t sleep until about 2 AM. I
                was
                thinking about us as well. It’s very difficult for me to be away from you, but I guess we both need this
                to
                really figure out where we are going. Try and get some sleep on the flight, and message me when
                possible. I
                don’t want you to text when you are with your folks. Safe flight to you and your folks. I too will miss
                you,
                very much.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t wait for the reply and got out of the bed to get ready for the day. I made a
                coffee
                and smoked a cigarette in the balcony before I hit the toilet. I had forgotten about Nicole message.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had a cold shower and got ready for the day. I wanted to go to the Puxi side of the
                bund and
                take a long walk, as this helped me think. It was still cold, so I had dressed in layers.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I made a protein shake with oats, protein powder, avocado, chia seeds and partially
                skimmed
                milk and took it to my dining table. I checked my phone to see if Jade has responded and she had indeed
                replied,
                during the time I was dressing up.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): We at the airport now waiting to check-in. I will text you once
                we are
                done.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I replied to her message immediately.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Okay baby. Message when you can. I am off to the Puxi side of
                the
                bund to take a walk. Take care. I know I said this before, but I will miss you. XOXO</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade’s reply was as instantaneous as mine.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): :-) You have fun. Yes, you told me before, but I am happy to
                hear that
                again, as I will miss you too Anand. Take care, and be safe when you walk, watch out for those illegally
                parked
                shared bikes. I don’t want you to trip over those by constantly playing and looking at the phone ;-).
                Okay, we
                are starting the check in now. Bye XOXOXO</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 21. The Long Walk</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">I took a Mobike to the metro station and the metro to the Lujiazui station. From there
                I walked
                to the pier on Fucheng road to and took the ferry across the Huangpu River to the Puxi side. If the
                ferry was
                crowded, as it tends to be during the holidays, I didn’t notice, as the playlist I was listening to at
                the time
                had blocked out most of the noise, and my mind busy with the thoughts of how to take forward the
                relationship
                with Jade helped block out the rest of the reality.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the time I reached the Puxi side of the bund, I was on auto-pilot. Only my thoughts
                for Jade
                and I existed.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">While walking along the promenade, I got a message from Jade letting me know they
                finished the
                security check and will be boarding the flight soon. I wished them a safe journey. She texted again just
                before
                turning off her phone, informing me that she was turning off her phone and sent a lot of WeChat hugs,
                kisses and
                hearts. I replied to her that I am eagerly waiting for her to return. I think she had turned off the
                phone by
                then, as I didn’t get any reply to those messages, not that my messages warranted any replies.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My walk took me to Shanghai People’s Heroes Memorial Tower, where I turned around and
                tracked
                back to the ferry stop and started walking towards the Nanpu Bridge Metro station. Once I reached Nanpu
                Bridge
                Station, instead of taking the metro, I walked back to the ferry stop, from where I walked down the East
                Nanjing
                Pedestrian Street, crossed over the people square and walked to JingAn Temple.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All this while, I tried to think about my long-term prospects with Jade Lin. I let my
                logical
                brain take over and analyse the pros and cons of the situation I was in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Even though Jade was a familiar person to me, I didn’t know her that well. While she’s
                beautiful, smart and intelligent, and our chemistry was fantastic, I was yet to see a real reason to be
                with
                Jade for the rest of my life. Objectively speaking, when I decided to sleep with her, my main motivation
                was
                sex. In all honesty, I had been sex-deprived for a long time. Since Jade was sexually attracted to me
                some time
                back and since she was alone in a noodle shop in the middle of the night, I had rolled the dice when we
                waited
                for the taxi at Xintiandi the previous night to see what would happen. It worked out in my favour.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I liked her, and I loved her external appearances, but is that enough to get into
                commitment or
                love her for the rest of my life as I had previously thought? I had some glimpses of the way she thought
                and
                acted, and from what I could see of that very thin slice, she was a good person. I cannot be worried
                about her
                past as, at our age, everyone has had some kind of experiences, good or bad and it’s really difficult to
                find
                someone without any baggage. I consider myself, in most cases, a good and honest person, but even I had
                not
                talked about my past and my baggage, except for my brother’s story.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">What if, deep in my subconscious, I had seen Jade as a way out of a middle-class life?
                While I
                was not poor by any stretch of the imagination, I wasn’t rich either and I wouldn’t even call myself
                upper-middle-class, the way my father described our family. I was afraid that I started “loving” Jade
                for her
                money after I came to know about her inheritance. I was not such a person before, as I never cared too
                much for
                money, but then people can change over time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">You spend all your life working hard hoping that one day you will “make it”. Often you
                discover
                very late that, most people like yourself, lived pay-check to pay-check, not because they are not
                intelligent or
                because they are not smart, but because they lack the courage to take the leap of faith – They fear
                failure,
                they fear adversity and they let the fear paralyse them and force them to hold on to comforts of safety.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I feared failure and adversity as much as the next man. I would love to say that I have
                done
                things that pushed my horizons, and rolled a lot of dices, but the fact is that I haven’t taken any real
                risks
                in my life. The fact that I stayed so long in Shanghai is the absolute proof that I was terrified of
                change and
                I didn’t like uncertainty. For people looking from outside, the feeling is that I have braved the odds,
                learnt
                the language, got an MBA degree and found success in a place like Shanghai, whereas the reality was I
                was
                desperately holding on to the familiar comforts of a known devil. The point is, while I was not a gold
                digger, I
                had to find a way to take money out of the equation while thinking about Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I chain-smoked three cigarettes while thinking about this and concluded that I didn’t
                care
                about how much money Jade had inherited. I knew this, as I had dated women with more money and lesser
                money and
                I had never let that come in way of feeling that I developed for them. It was a non-factor in the
                relationship
                for me. I was happy that Jade had a bunch of money, but I was going to work hard to make sure that she
                has
                everything that her heart desires, should we get into a long-term relationship.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">At the same time, I concluded that her Italian passport is not a factor as well for me
                in this
                relationship, although if she wanted, I was okay to make the move to Europe, even if the opportunities
                might be
                a bit lesser for me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also concluded that I might have declared my love for her a little too quickly and
                the fact
                of the matter was – I liked her a lot, I was sexually attracted to her, and that I need some more time
                before
                deciding if I did love her, and more importantly If I wanted us to spend a lifetime together. I made a
                mental
                note to ensure that, I talk about this to Jade, whenever we video chatted the next time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All this while I was thinking about this from my point of view, and it felt a little
                selfish to
                me. I tried putting myself in Jade’s shoes, realised that she might be scratching a seven-year itch she
                felt for
                me way back then. Now that, that itch is scratched, does she have a real reason to be with me?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When she said, she loved me, what exactly did she mean? What if she hadn’t thought this
                through? But the fact that she wanted to take slow and get to know me better, was a good sign for me, as
                it
                meant she has thought about this for some time, as she said before. This also meant that when she
                professed her
                possible love for me, it came from a place deep within. It is also possible that she was scared that I
                might
                walk off if she didn’t say those words, as sex might hold a different, a less scared, and meaning to me.
                She
                might have intuited that I have been sex deprived and was rolling the dice when I made the move and
                kissed her.
                She might have also guessed from the way we made love, that I was attracted to her and liked her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was truly a confusing thought with many circular, chicken and egg sort of
                questions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tried thinking from the perspective of our respective parents. My parents were at
                that point
                where they would be happy if I found a girl to share my life with, preferably through the bonds of
                marriage.
                They didn’t care where the girl was from but requested me to marry someone who wouldn’t force me to
                change my
                religion, essentially implying I don’t marry someone from Pakistan or the Middle East. What can I say
                even my
                open-minded parents were biased in some ways. I was fairly certain that Jade doesn’t practice any
                religion, but
                even if she did, she didn’t seem like a person who would force her religion on anyone else. But, this
                remains to
                be seen. Being mostly an agnostic I can pretend to be religious for my parents and family, but when it
                comes to
                Jade, I wasn’t sure I could do that.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew that I faced an uphill challenge when it comes to convincing Jade’s mother, as
                her mom
                and her daughter have themselves gone through a divorce. It would only be fair for Jade’s mother to be
                worried
                about her daughter being with a foreigner, that too an Indian. Since marrying a rich Chinese didn’t work
                out for
                Jade, her mother might be willing to give an Indian a chance. In any case, I knew that eventually when I
                had to
                talk to Jade’s mother and her Chinese grandparents, it will be a challenge due to one reason or the
                other. I had
                no idea how they felt about Indians in general and what their thoughts are about this particular Indian.
                I hoped
                that, if and when the time came, my Chinese language skills would help… somewhat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There is the question of what my friends would think, should they find out how quickly
                we
                professed love for each other. I was immediately ashamed of this thought as, if I loved Jade, I
                shouldn’t fear
                what the ‘society’ thinks about us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also started thinking about my health and Jade’s health and realised that we
                shouldn’t be
                smoking so much should we were to have a long and healthy life together. I decided that I should try to
                give up
                smoking during these three weeks and set an example for Jade. I still had about a pack and a half of
                cigarettes
                remaining and I promised myself that I will quit smoking as soon as I finished the remaining cigarettes.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">In the end, I decided that she may love me, or the version of me she knew from seven
                years back
                and the one she slept with, but she hasn’t seen all sides of me. She will need some time to see that.
                She will
                have to know what my real background was, what my real values are and I will have to do the same for
                Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This holiday break would be a good time for both of us also to think about what we
                wanted from
                each other and think about what needs to be done one once we are back together.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had reached the JingAn metro station, a few minutes after the long train of my
                thoughts, had
                come to a halt. As I entered the metro station, I concluded that I had to convey some of these thoughts
                to Jade
                and I didn’t want to wait until I talked to Jade directly, as God (if there is one) alone knew when that
                would
                happen.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I opened my quip app and started writing out the message to Jade. I thought I would be
                done by
                the time I got into the next train, but I had underestimated my capacity to ramble when I’m writing down
                my
                thoughts. I was already crossing over to the Pudong side of the river, and nowhere near completing the
                message.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">On a whim, I got out at the DongChang Road station. I headed to Blue Frog located at
                the
                basement of the Shanghai World Financial Centre to have a drink or two – because the happy hour was
                starting in
                less than five minutes – and complete my message to Jade.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365572">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 22. The Long Text Message</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Two gin martinis later, the message was done, and it was way longer than expected. I
                had
                expected to get this done in less than half an hour but had finally spent close to two hours writing
                that
                message.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had two choices, send one very long message on WeChat or send her an email. I decided
                that I
                will do both, in case either of us accidentally deletes the WeChat message.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Instead of sending the message directly, over the next hour, I broke it into paragraphs
                and
                ensured that I didn’t make any obvious spelling or grammatical error. I then pasted each paragraph into
                the chat
                box and send them one by one.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I got Jade’s email address from her Facebook profile and send the whole message, which
                was more
                like a thought dump, as an email.</p>
            <div class="email-block">

                <p class="email-content">Dear Jade,</p>

                    the
                    message and you can read it easily as an email. I got your email address from your Facebook profile.
                </p>
                <p class="email-content">I hope you are getting enough rest on the flight. I just finished a long walk
                    and now I
                    am in the Blue Frog located in the basement of SWFC.</p>
                <p class="email-content">As I walked along bund and streets of Shanghai, I was thinking about how fate
                    or the
                    universe or some higher power brought us back together, especially at a time where we needed each
                    other. It
                    was meant to happen, why else would we run into each other in that noodle restaurant, a place where
                    we had
                    the least likelihood of meeting on a Saturday night.</p>
                <p class="email-content">Whenever I think of you, I am reminded of the wonderful time we spent together.
                    You are
                    always in my thoughts ever since we first met, all those years back, and now, you have a permanent
                    place in
                    my heart. I hope you feel the same way about me.</p>
                <p class="email-content">During the walk, I had an opportunity to ponder your point about thinking hard
                    about
                    spending our lives together, and I think you are right. Such decisions cannot be made so suddenly,
                    as we
                    live in a world where relationships are becoming more and more complex and nothing is truly certain.
                </p>
                <p class="email-content">We both must think hard about this.</p>
                <p class="email-content">Previous experiences would have shown us that we try to show our best to the
                    other at
                    the beginning of the relationship because we are afraid of losing each other. Fear as a foundation
                    for any
                    relationship would only lead to disaster in the future. I believe, after much thought, we should
                    take time
                    to discover each other’s weaknesses as well as the bad sides.</p>
                <p class="email-content">You told me about your divorce and it was then I realised that we both had our
                    share of
                    bad relationships even before we had met each other. I should have told you about my own failed
                    marriage,
                    and I had many opportunities to talk about it, but somehow couldn’t find the courage to talk about
                    this.
                    Better late than never… I guess.</p>
                <p class="email-content">This happened when I was 27, and I had just got married to the love of my life,
                    whom I
                    had known for seven years. I thought I knew her well, only to discover within the week of our
                    marriage, she
                    would rather be with her lover. I found out about this in the most painful way, after she eloped
                    with her
                    lover, on the seventh day after getting married. She sent me a text informing me that she cannot
                    live
                    without her lover whom she had met six months back at work.</p>
                <p class="email-content">I was mentally destroyed and filed for an annulment of marriage. I took the
                    first
                    available opportunity to leave India and by the end of the year, I was in Shanghai.</p>
                <p class="email-content">The lesson learnt for me was that ‘love’ can be a fickle thing, and only plays
                    a small
                    part in the success of any relationship. We need to be able to develop trust and respect between the
                    partners in the relationship. We need to be able to accept people for who they are without focussing
                    on
                    their shortcomings, as nobody is perfect, and if there is God he made me truly imperfect. We need to
                    find a
                    way to keep falling in love again and again with the same person so that we will not need anyone
                    else and we
                    can have a happy life together, for the rest of our lives.</p>
                <p class="email-content">Having said that I don’t want us to be starting this relationship with a lie. I
                    want
                    you to know that I like you a lot and I adore you, but I may have panicked when you told me you may
                    be in
                    love with me and replied the same way. I want to love you and I am hoping that I will fall in love
                    with you
                    a thousand times over so that we can be together... forever. Don’t think that I don’t care for you
                    or I want
                    to hurt you. It’s only because I care for you I want to be honest.</p>
                <p class="email-content">I want us to be together… if possible, for the rest of our lives, but let us
                    both take
                    a step back and be very sure of this. I want us to experience life together and maybe even live
                    together for
                    a while, before taking the next steps together.</p>
                <p class="email-content">I miss you terribly and I am eagerly waiting for you to come back into my arms.
                </p>
                <p class="email-signature">Anand</p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">After I sent the email, I texted Jade and told her that I have sent the same message as
                an
                email to the address she used for registering her Facebook.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I needed some food in my stomach now, as the booze was going to my head. I ordered a
                medium
                done cheeseburger minus the onions and tomatoes and swapped the fries out for a salad. I wanted to start
                focussing on my health and I wanted to make changes to my lifestyle right away. As I ate my burger I
                realised
                that I still had to check the messages from Allen. I opened the chat and responded to it immediately. He
                had
                invited me for a get-together the weekend after the next. I immediately accepted the invitation and
                promised I
                would be there. He told me that he wanted all the details from the past couple of day. In his own words,
                “not
                the summary, but the complete details.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I headed back home after the burger, took a shower and turned in for the night. I put
                my phone
                into Airplane mode and made a mental note to check Nicole’s message in the morning. It might be just a
                message,
                but once every while, that message will trigger a long conversation, that would ruin my sleep or even
                the whole
                night. I guess we all had similar experiences in our life before.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 23. Waiting for A Response</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The next day, I woke up at around 8:00 AM and decided that I should start the day with
                my usual
                workout. I managed to complete the workout in just under 40 minutes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After my usual ablutions, I made my breakfast and while eating my breakfast, opened up
                the
                phone to check if there were any messages and discovered that I had two well-spaced messages from Jade
                sent
                sometime during the night.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The first message was a normal message, which probably meant that she hadn’t read my
                long chain
                of messages yet.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Hey Anand, we reached Palermo safely and we are at my Father’s
                home
                now. I think I remember some of the rooms and definitely remember his Alfa Romeo, which he has tuned and
                maintained to perfection... Still looks brand new. The flight was good and I managed to get some sleep.
                I saw
                that you were messaging like crazy, let me read them and text you back. I miss you like crazy, my
                darling.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">About an hour later she texted back, presumably after reading my long text or email.
            </p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Jade Lin (WeChat): Anand, thank you for being honest. You are right we need to
                take it
                slow and we need to get to know each other well, given our pasts. I know what I feel for you is true,
                you take
                your time to decide dear. I still miss you, I still think I am falling in love with you and I still am
                not
                pushing you :-). Take care darling XOXOXOXO.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">That was that. There were no messages after. I didn’t know what the last message meant.
                Did I
                make a mistake by telling the truth? Did I panic and say that I might not love Jade whereas what I felt
                for her
                was, truly love? I shook all these thoughts and feelings as I knew that I had to remain strong.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I went through the messages Jade sent me again and to me, it felt like she’s willing to
                give me
                some time and space to decide how do we go forward, so I decided to keep my reply simple.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): I am sure that everything will work out. You know me, I am
                terrified
                of my past and I just don’t want to end up hurting you. You take care of your stuff there and don’t
                worry about
                me. I miss you every moment and I am waiting eagerly for you here. I really, really want us to be
                together and I
                mean it, but let us take it slow. You too Take care darling, XOXOXO.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I waited for about five minutes for a response, but it was stupid as Jade was probably
                sleeping.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had nearly finished breakfast when I remembered that I still had an unread message
                from
                Nicole. I tapped open her WeChat message and read it. She had sent this message an hour before Jade had
                messaged
                me on her way to the airport, the day before.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hi, Anand. How are you? I am sorry about cancelling on you
                the last
                minute. If you are free tomorrow, can we meet up at the Element Fresh for lunch or dinner? I hope to
                meet you in
                person and talk more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Since she had sent this on the day before and since it was too late for lunch now, I
                knew I
                should check with her for dinner. I texted her back immediately.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hey Nicole. Apologies for not responding earlier, I was
                caught up in
                something. If you are free today evening, can we meet for dinner? I am okay with whichever place you
                choose.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She texted back in the next five minutes or so.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hi, Anand. No worries. If you are okay, can we meet at the
                Blue
                Frog in 96 Plaza by 6:00 PM? This is the one near Century Avenue Station. Let us catch the happy-hour
                there.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I texted back to confirm my availability and I got the reply almost immediately.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Sounds good to me and I know the place. See you there at six
                :-).</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): See you soon, Anand :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If it were any other day, I would have been really happy with the outcome of this
                conversation,
                but my mind was really on Jade and was trying to think what was going through her mind. There was
                nothing I
                could do until Jade replied.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I decided to clean my apartment and organise things around my house to keep my mind off
                Jade
                Lin and stop thinking about how our relationship was going to pan out.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Cleaning the house was a soothing, meditative experience for me, and it generally
                helped me to
                keep my mind off whatever was troubling me. I vacuumed the house twice and mopped the floor twice, not
                because
                the house was dirty, but because of the therapeutic effect, it had on me. This was no different and I
                nearly
                forgot about my love troubles. I finished my clean-up by organising my pile of DVD, which took way
                longer than I
                expected.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was sweaty and smelly from the workout as well as from cleaning and organising my
                house. I
                needed a shower. I guess Jade will see the message when she will see the message and she will do what
                she will
                have to do when she feels like it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I took a long, cold shower to wash all the weariness out of my body. The icy needles of
                water
                washed away sweat from my body. It helped me relax further even though I was shaking and shivering from
                the
                cold.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After nearly five minutes in the cold shower, my body couldn’t take it anymore. I
                walked out
                the shower, shaking to the core and towelled myself dry vigorously. Even though the bathroom was cold, I
                felt a
                rush of warmth due to the temperature differential. I got into the bedroom and dressed up quickly. I was
                still
                shivering a bit even after dressing up, so I turned up the heat a couple of degrees.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I sat on the edge of the bed and checked my phone for messages. Jade hadn’t responded
                to my
                text. There were some group messages that I cleared out as most of the message were in Chinese and
                reading all
                those messages will take me forever. There was a message from Nicole.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): Hi, Anand. I was thinking of biking to 96 Plaza. Do you
                want to
                bike with me? I will leave by 5:30 PM.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t know what to think of that offer. It’s after all only a bike ride and I had
                nothing to
                lose from this. It was better than her cancelling on me, again.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hey Nicole. I am good with that. I can take a Mobike. I will
                meet you
                at your community gate by 5:30 PM.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The reply was near-instantaneous like she was waiting for a reply.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Nicole Zhang (WeChat): See you near the East Gate by Huamu Road :-).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I got ready by 5:15 PM and got out of my community to find a Mobike. I managed to find
                one with
                an adjustable seat, and I unlocked the bike by scanning the QR code. I checked my phone for a message
                from Jade
                and she still hadn’t messaged. I rode the bike up the road to the entrance of Nicole’s community and
                waited by
                the gate for Nicole to show up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She came out at exactly at 5:30 PM and she was riding her city bike. She was wearing a
                burgundy
                turtleneck sweater and a pair of black jeans. She also was wearing a white down jacket with a hoodie to
                protect
                her from the cold. She saw me and waved at me and rode her bike towards me. She looked happy even from
                this
                distance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey Anand, Good to see you”, she said with this huge smile on her face, “Sorry, I had
                to
                change the plans so many times.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hey Nicole, it is good to see you too”, I replied and added “Don’t worry about it. I
                am happy
                that we could meet.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was feeling happy with the change in scenery and decided that I am not going to let
                thoughts
                of Jade get in way of this dinner. Whatever happens, is beyond my control now and my thought was that I
                should
                accept the outcome no matter what. I could, of course, have recalled the message, or not sent the email,
                but now
                it’s a little too late.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Just when I was about to space out thinking about how not to space out, Nicole’s phone
                dinged
                loudly then. She muted the phone and apologised for the intrusion.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I dismissed the apology but did the same with my phone as I had a feeling that Jade was
                not
                going to message me and even if she messaged me, it might be something that I didn’t want to hear.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Avoidance can sometimes help you deal with bad situations.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We started biking towards Blue Frog and I just followed Nicole as I had never biked to
                96
                Plaza. She seemed familiar with the route and we reached there around 5:45 PM, after illegally riding
                the bike
                on roads where you are not allowed to ride bikes. Nicole had to hunt around to find a parking spot for
                her bike,
                as she needed to lock the bike. She locked her bike using one chain lock and a normal bike lock, both of
                which
                you can find in any Decathlon store in Shanghai.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I just locked the bike to end my ride and ensured that I got the signature triple beeps
                (beep-beep-beep) confirming that the bike was locked. I checked my phone to confirm that the payment has
                been
                made. I sneaked a peek at my WeChat to see if there were any messages and there were none.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some promises, especially to yourself, are hard to keep. Like promises to lose weight,
                go to
                the gym, eat healthy, drink less, or quit smoking – for some people like me, it never happens.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I put my phone back into my pocket and I walked with Nicole to the Blue Frog. We found
                a table
                as soon as we reached there and we were seated quickly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I ordered a Blue Frog Long Island Ice Tea and a Mexican Burger, minus onions and
                tomatoes, with
                a side of sweet potato fries with mayonnaise and mustard. Sweet potato fries are ‘healthier’ in my
                opinion, so
                that was a win. Nicole ordered a Blue Frog mojito and a Caesar salad. If she wasn’t so beautiful, I
                would have
                hated her for making me feel guilty for ordering such an unhealthy dinner.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we waited for the drink to come, Nicole apologised again for cancelling out on me.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I had some emergency work that came to me. It was a big opportunity so, I didn’t want
                to turn
                it down”, she said apologetically.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Don’t worry about it, we have all been in such situations”, I said not caring about
                the
                cancellation as it allowed me to spend some time with Jade before she left.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, is this opportunity something you want to talk about?”, I followed up as the
                curiosity got
                the best of me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Her face lit up with happiness and Nicole looked like she was going to burst with joy.
                Our
                drinks just arrived around then and she took a sip of her drink and launched right into her story.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She explained how on Saturday evening how one of her friends in the venture capitalist
                circles
                had messaged her asking her if she was looking for investors to scale up her business. This was one of
                the
                bigger names in the industry and she wanted to meet the guy to understand what was on the table.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">They had planned their meeting on Monday afternoon and she was not sure when she would
                be able
                to complete the discussion, which is why she postponed the meeting a couple of times.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She had spent the whole of Sunday and the Monday morning preparing her business plan,
                including
                her marketing plan, competitor analysis, financial and future expansion plans. The meeting with her VC
                friend
                went well and the company is interested in investing in her company, especially since she was developing
                a
                digital strategy for her company. I was truly happy for her, as she seemed to be very committed to what
                she was
                doing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was a bit distracted as I couldn’t stop thinking about Jade. I was itching to check
                my phone
                to see if Jade had messaged back. Although I was smiling on the outside, I not very happy. I was
                conflicted. It
                appeared that Jade and I didn’t understand each other well, and we were off on the wrong foot. She
                proclaimed
                her love for me without expecting anything, only to have me do the same and back off in less than
                twenty-four
                hours.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When Jade and I were with each other, we were in the moment, but my problem was that,
                when I am
                not with her, my mind was all over the place, and I was filled with insecurities. Out of site, was not
                really
                out of mind. When I am not with her, I obsessively thought about her… Jade was like an addiction for me,
                and I
                am not sure if addictions or obsession are a good way to describe a relationship. Perhaps, we need some
                time to
                understand each other better. We are different people after all. There was another thought in my mind,
                which I
                chose to ignore – that perhaps Jade and I aren’t a good fit for various reasons, including but not
                limited to
                the way we think about each other’s way of thinking. Perhaps, we should accept that we are oil and water
                and
                would never be suitable for each other no matter what we do.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">But… Jade is not here now, so I forced myself to focus on now and the present.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole was talking about the digital strategy for her company and I was pleasantly
                surprised to
                find out that she had done quite an amount of research and groundwork. This being something I was
                familiar with,
                I started walking her through the product plan and convinced her that she should focus on the Minimum
                Viable
                Product or the MVP rather than going all in.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we ate our dinners, Nicole and I discussed what should go into the MVP for her
                product. For
                her students, the foundation material she developed, along with her unique teaching methods, especially
                for
                English and Analytical reasoning were the unique propositions. The materials were so good that some of
                the
                unscrupulous competitors were pirating her material and using it in their courses. So, we decided that
                MVP
                should include a secure digital delivery system for these materials to help build a strong user base,
                ensure
                “customer stickiness” and the security of the system.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was convinced that she should add an analytics platform in the backend (or what the
                customer doesn’t see) to improve the effectiveness of the system. Again, I was blown away by the fact
                that she
                has thought about a lot of things a usual small business owner wouldn’t think about. She was already
                thinking
                like an entrepreneur. We discussed more on this aspect and decided to adopt the MVP approach for this as
                well,
                electing to depend on freely available open-source tools to manage the analytics part until the business
                is big
                enough.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We discussed a lot of ideas and I found that I was able to contribute to the discussion
                without
                having to think too hard. The thoughts and conversation just flowed. This felt good, having a
                conversation
                without being scared of what may or may not be the reaction. Just a couple of friends having a
                conversation,
                that’s all.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the time we finished our dinner and the second round of drinks from the happy hour,
                it was
                well past 9:00 PM and we were thinking about ordering the third round. I realised that I didn’t want to
                check my
                message and see if Jade had replied.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was having too good a time to worry about that and if that was selfish, so be it. I
                was game
                for the third round of drink so was Nicole, so we repeated the order.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I could see that Nicole was happy because of the discussion we just had, and she seemed
                willing
                to talk more. It might also be the alcohol loosening her tongue and lowering her usual barriers.
                Probably a good
                time to find out why she freaked out on the metro. I gently broached the subject once our drinks were
                served.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">“So, Nicole, do you want to talk about what happened on the train the other day?” I
                asked as
                she took a sip of the drink.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">If she was surprised or shocked by the abrupt change in subject, it didn’t show on her
                face.
                The smile was gone for sure, so I knew it was something bad, though I was not sure how bad. I had bad
                timing and
                never really thought about what to say before I opened my damn mouth.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole started stirring her drink, and she appeared to be trying to put words to her
                thought.
                She took a long sip of her drink before she talked again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“My parents died in the Wenzhou train collision in 2011”, she said matter-of-factly
                after about
                a minute of stirring the drink. I needed no further explanation, as to why she was so shook-up the other
                day. I
                was surprised that she was holding on to her composure so well now and that she still uses trains for
                her
                commute.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Wenzhou train collision happened on July 2011, on a viaduct in the suburbs of
                Wenzhou,
                derailing two high-speed trains and had led to about 40 deaths (reportedly). I never thought I would
                ever meet
                someone who had such a close connection to the incident.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am truly sorry for your loss, and I am truly an idiot to bring this up”, I
                apologised as
                sincerely as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She shook her head to convey it is not my fault, “It’s okay. I never told you anything
                about my
                parents.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">While that might be true, I felt guilty about it. I barely knew her and it felt like I
                had
                crossed a line. I would probably never know how that loss felt like. I had lost a brother to an accident
                but to
                lose both your parent at the same time was nothing but unthinkable. Also, she was dealing with it far
                better
                than I could ever deal with such a loss. Usually, the moment I start talking about my brother, I had to
                fight
                hard to hold back the tears.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There was a faint trace of sadness in her voice and a flicker of sadness in her eyes,
                but that
                was it. She had come to term with it, but the fear was just under the surface, as I found out a couple
                of days
                back when the train came to a violent halt. In that instant, she relived a nightmare her parents
                suffered, and
                some thought she had suppressed for a long time may have come to the surface. I admired her even more
                now since
                she was not afraid to take trains.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“You cannot let the past rule you, and though it has been difficult and even though I
                miss
                them, everyone, I have accepted it and moved on with my life”, Nicole said breaking my train of
                thoughts. She
                had a sad smile on her face which said more than any words could explain. I could see that she had
                almost let go
                of the past, but her parents were always in her heart and her nightmares.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When someone close to you dies, it affects you deeply; a part of you dies with that
                person. The
                closer you are to the person, bigger that part. This happened when my younger brother was taken from us…
                That
                part will never come back or grow back. I am sure that when my parents leave this world, hopefully from
                old age,
                it will be the same with me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was almost like the words from that Aerosmith song… <em>There’s a hole in my soul
                    that’s
                    killing me forever.</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">“A part of me died that day and left an emptiness that will never leave me, but as I
                said, I
                have learnt to live with it”, she said, voicing my thoughts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I know how that feels. I had lost my younger brother in an accident. I had not
                accepted it for
                a long time, it was too difficult for me to accept it”, I replied, surprisingly calm. Perhaps, the
                calmness she
                displayed had some effect on me as well.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am sorry for your loss Anand. Do you want to tell me what happened?” She asked me,
                leaning
                forward and meeting my eyes. I saw some sadness in her eyes, but she didn’t lose control.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I recounted very calmly, how I had lost my younger brother to a motorbike accident a
                few years
                back. I could see empathy in Nicole’s eyes, and we felt closer to each other as we shared a similar
                experience
                of losing people we loved in similar situations. My calmness as I talked to her surprised me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The fact is that, in this world, people are experiencing bigger pain than what I or
                Nicole was
                going through and I was fairly sure that I will probably never know such pain – People losing loved
                ones, people
                starving day in day out, people dying of diseases, people losing everything they owned to natural
                disasters.
                This was a very sobering realisation for me. The fact is that people still deal with these situations
                without
                losing their maids or throwing a tantrum – the way I immaturely used to do. Reality is that they have
                learnt to
                live with it and be mature about it.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We didn’t say anything for the next few minutes and were lost in the memories of loved
                ones
                that were violently taken away from us. We quietly sipped our drinks and I wondered what we should talk
                about
                next. Nicole was had nearly finished her drinks and she helped to decide for us.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am feeling quite tipsy now. I think I am done. Can we leave now, if you are okay?”
                she asked
                me, her words slurring a bit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although I was perfectly okay, and Nicole looked okay to me, it was clear that Nicole
                wanted to
                leave. I called for the bill and after much back and forth, the usual Chinese way, Nicole finally let me
                pay the
                bill. She thanked me for the dinner and to me, she looked happy with the fact that I paid the bill.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we walked out of the restaurant, Nicole grabbed my arms and linked her arms with
                mine,
                making me blush visibly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Sorry, I am a bit drunk, and I don’t want to trip and fall. I hope you don’t mind”,
                Nicole
                mumbled when she saw that I was blushing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“No, no… It’s fine”, I said swallowing the lump my throat and trying to act natural. I
                could
                smell her perfume and it sort of personified her nature – positive and down to earth. It was a pleasant
                feeling…
                nothing sexual, but sort of relaxing, calming sense.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I walked with her to the place where she had parked her bike, but I was concerned that
                she
                might not be able to bike back home, as she was starting to look drunk. I thought it would be better to
                take a
                taxi back home rather than risk biking back in her current state. The bike was double-locked, and maybe
                we can
                move the bike near the hotel next to 96 Plaza, as that place is always well lit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nicole, are you sure you can ride back home?” I asked her as we reached the parking
                lot, and
                added pointing at the hotel, “Let’s take a taxi back home. We can leave the bike at that hotel and come
                back
                tomorrow.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I am fine, I just need to get some fresh air”, she replied confidently, unlinking her
                arms
                from mine and fishing out her bike key, but her words were slurring a bit.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Okay, in which case, we will ride slowly and we will ride together”, I offered as a
                compromise.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She smiled and nodded in agreement and that was that.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I spend the next couple of minutes, trying to find a Mobike with an adjustable seat. I
                was
                tempted to download the Ofo app as most of them had adjustable seats, and it was good Mandarin practice
                for me.
                I finally found one about fifty meters away from where Nicole had parked her bike and unlocked it using
                my
                Mobike app.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We rode back very slowly and I relied on my phone to give me directions back home. The
                phone’s
                voice-over directions were useless as the level of my Mandarin nosedives after a couple of drinks, so I
                relied
                solely on the arrow on the map to lead us back home. Nicole was humming some song and had a happy smile
                playing
                on her lips. Her bike was scarily wobbly, but given the amount of alcohol she had consumed, her balance
                was very
                impressive.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All the way, my attention was split between Nicole and my phone screen. I had a couple
                of
                scares as Nicole nearly lost her balance or when I nearly dropped my phone when I tried to maintain my
                balance
                and hold the handlebar with nothing but my left little finger.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We reached her community and I parked the Mobike outside community, in the designated
                bike
                parking area, while Nicole got off the bike and waited for me to lock the bike. I locked the bike and
                walked
                with her into the community. She seemed to have sobered up a bit, thanks to the bike ride. I walked her
                to her
                apartment building. We didn’t speak to each other and I guess there was no need to talk. We live in
                societies
                where your ability to “communicate” is confused with the ability to “speak” non-stop. She was happy and
                I was
                feeling more or less upbeat. We reached the apartment building and I knew I had to say something before
                I headed
                back home.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Nicole, I had a great time today evening. I hope we can do this again some other
                time”, I said
                bidding her farewell. I am not sure why, but I extended my hand awkwardly for a handshake.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She giggled at my awkward gesture and said, “Come on Anand… Don’t be a stranger, hug
                me!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was surprised by this response and stood there awkwardly not sure if I should make
                the first
                move. Nicole sensed my hesitation, stepped close to me and hugged me. After a moment of hesitation, I
                hugged her
                back and started counting Mississippi’s in my head. We let go of each other after three Mississippi’s.
                We stood
                there for a moment smiling at each other.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“I had a great time too”, Nicole said breaking the silence, “I too hope that we can
                meet some
                other time.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“See you around Nicole”, I said barely able to stop smiling.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“See you around Anand”, she replied.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I waited for her to get into the apartment building. Nicole swiped into the building
                and she
                turned around to wave goodbye. I waved back and started walking back to my apartment. I was back home in
                my
                apartment complex in less than ten minutes. I got on to the lift and remembered that I have not seen my
                cell
                phone for a long time now and I might have messages from Jade. I took out the phone, unlocked it, and
                opened
                WeChat.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I got into the apartment, I saw that there were some random messages from certain
                groups
                (messages in Chinese) and a couple of messages from Allen Huang, but there were no messages from Jade. I
                didn’t
                think much of it earlier as I wanted to give her some space. I checked her moments and didn’t see
                anything for
                the whole day, but then she had a bunch of personal stuff to deal with, so perhaps she was busy with
                that.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In any case, I decided that I should text Jade to see if she was doing okay.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Hey Jade. Darling, I hope you are okay and hope you are
                having a good
                time there. Do text when you have time. I miss you.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I sighed and locked my phone and hooked it up to the charger. I headed to the bathroom
                and took
                a quick shower. I towelled myself dry, dressed up for the night. I got into my bed and checked my phone
                for a
                response from Jade, but there were none. I sighed again, turned off the lights and got under the
                comforter. I
                was out in less than five minutes. As I drifted off into a peaceful slumber, I hoped that I would have
                some
                response from Jade in the morning. I couldn’t wait for Jade to be back in Shanghai, so that I could hold
                her in
                my arms, kiss her and make love to her.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 24. Different Stages of Heartbreak</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">There were no messages from Jade the next day or the day after or the day after that.
                There
                would never be any more messages from Jade. Even though I was on the edge, and a bit angry, I resisted
                the urge
                to send nasty messages or try calling her.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Space is important</em>, I told myself and I did not want to seem desperate;
                <em>Man up,
                    don’t let her control you</em> I reminded myself again and again.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As men, we all know we have to suppress our emotions and hide our true feeling from the
                world.
                This is one of the joys of being a man – the moment you show your emotions, you are seen as weak,
                someone who
                will not be respected by peers. It was also possible that the estate matters kept her occupied, though
                even I
                knew that was ridiculous – how long does it take to tap out a simple message like “I am okay” or “I miss
                you”?
                Not that long. Really… I tried it out and it takes less than 10 seconds, even without auto-complete.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the fourth day, fear and self-doubt replaced the anger. In my imagination, she was
                possibly
                seduced by an Italian or European playboy who was a million times more attractive than I ever could be,
                who as
                million times as smarter and she had more or less forgotten about me. I spend the next three days,
                messaging her
                on WeChat, and Facebook messenger, since she might have lost her phone and she was not able to message
                me, so I
                wanted to cover all the possible avenues.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the seventh day, I was sure she was intentionally ignoring my messages. I had also
                run out
                of patience and started calling her on WeChat and Facebook messenger hoping that this would somehow
                help… I was
                also confused as to why she hadn’t just blocked me and put me out of my misery. If this was some sort of
                a sick
                power play, it was working. The tone of my messages went from normal to pleading to imploring to
                downright
                begging, with many “please” and “sorry” in most of the messages. I got a feeling that I was being
                ghosted.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The eighth day, I was back at work, but work had taken the back burner and I was barely
                able to
                keep away from my phone. Every time the phone vibrated, I thought it would be a message from Jade –
                which it
                wasn’t – and would check my phone immediately, no matter what I was doing at that time or whom I was
                with at
                that time. Given my previous record, most of the people turned a blind eye towards my behavioural
                digression,
                which they thought might be temporary.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">During this phase, I was fearful, angry and sad all the time. I wanted closure, but it
                appeared
                that I was not going to get closure from Jade Lin. In my imagination, she had played with me and used me
                to get
                to some ulterior goal – some other guy – by making him jealous of our “relationship”. In my selfish,
                small
                imagination, after she got the guy, she just ghosted me. What can I say; the downward spiral was quick,
                nasty
                and thoroughly unimaginative.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The next stage was madness. I trusted my gut and my instincts so much that, I had
                convinced
                myself that she had found someone else, even though, there was no proof of this from the emotions Jade
                showed
                during the time we spent together or anywhere on the social media where I stalked her to find the reason
                she
                ghosted me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Finally, I felt disgusted with myself, the way I desperately chased someone who didn’t
                want to
                be with me. For me, these insane thoughts concluded that, if she can so easily find someone else for no
                real
                apparent reason, I should do the same. My feelings for Jade, the infatuation/attraction/love I felt (In
                that
                moment of anger I wasn’t sure what I felt), the inability to let go, my insecurities all came gushing
                forth that
                instant. The truth is that I never took a minute to look at this logically and calmly, but then logic
                and calm
                were all out of the equation at that point. After all, any logical man would have made efforts to ensure
                that
                the person he cares for is okay.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">On the thirteenth day, the day before Allen Huang’s party, I deleted the chat with Jade
                Lin and
                that evening, and I went to one of the many clubs in Shanghai to celebrate my “freedom”. After four
                hours of
                drinking and dancing (which was me flailing my body around and occasionally throwing my hands up – I was
                never a
                good dancer, I will never be one; Then and there, I broke the stereotype about all Indians being good
                dancers),
                I started hitting on women there without any actual thoughts of next steps. If they turned out to be
                hookers, I
                moved on to the next target. On a scale of one to five, I was “absolutely hopeless” when it came to
                hitting on
                women. Despite this, I was my usual unrestrained drunk confident self that evening.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Even the question “Where are you from?” which usually meant the death of conversation
                after
                they get to know I am from India, didn’t upset me. I used various responses like “Isn’t it obvious that
                I am
                from India?” or “I am from the land of Kamasutra” or “I will give you a clue – Slumdog Millionaire” or
                “I am not
                from the US, the UK, Europe, or Australia, as you can see from my accent” or even a bold “Does it
                matter? It’s
                not like we are going to get married anyway”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The last response was to as Eastern European or Russian lady who looked older than me.
                She was
                an average looking person, average height, but shorter than me and most of the other men in the club
                were
                ignoring her and she was busy ignoring some desperate club goers. I had walked up to her, introduced
                myself and
                asked her politely if I can join her for a drink. She was a bit surprised, possibly by my politeness,
                and nodded
                her head in agreement.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She introduced herself as Anastasia from Moscow who has been living in China for the
                past
                fifteen years. She spoke jaw-dropping-good Chinese, at least when she ordered her booze.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We eventually started talking and soon started discussing our respective life in China.
                I was
                bullshitting about the philosophy of life using a fake British accent and had paused to take a drink
                when she
                finally asked the question (Imagine this in Russian accent – “Where you from, Anand?”) and I gave that
                answer,
                the one about getting married – and added in my normal accent, “… but, I am from India”. She looked
                stunned for
                a moment before she burst out into laughter. I knew that moment, that I had scored because I was
                expecting a
                slap.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We continued talking, but there was this perceptible expectation hanging in the air
                between us.
                We knew where this night was heading, but neither had a polite way to rush this forward. But thankfully,
                Ed
                Sheeran saved the day for us, with a remixed version of “Shape of You” which was what the DJ decided to
                play
                that moment. We took one look at each other, drained our drinks and hit the dance floor, where I gyrated
                wildly
                and she danced like an angel. When the song was done we stepped out laughing and giggling and got the
                next round
                of drinks. I was not sure of the next move, and Anastasia sensed my hesitation. She leaned in and kissed
                me full
                on my lips, and it was surprisingly full of promises. The kiss was long and deep. When we finally broke
                the
                kiss, we knew the time had come for us to leave.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We finished our drinks quickly and headed to a nearby Motel 168. We both knew that this
                is not
                something we wanted to do in our apartment but a neutral zone. The clerk knew exactly what we wanted and
                proactively offered us the 6-hour package in one of the better rooms.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We took him up on the offer.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When we parted ways during the wee hours of the next day, we didn’t exchange our
                numbers but
                added each other on WeChat. With that, the silent agreement was in place – Anastasia Last-Name-Unknown
                (her
                WeChat also said just Anastasia) and I were unofficially friends-with-benefits and nothing else until
                one of us
                moves on in life. I was fairly certain it wouldn’t be me. Also, I was not sure if there would be the
                next time,
                as these are one-shot deals.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I slept through the day and woke up at 3 PM. I checked my phone out of habit and there
                were a
                couple of messages, one from Allen and one from Anastasia. I checked the message from Anastasia.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anastasia (WeChat): Anand, it was fun last night. Keep in touch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The message from Allen was just a reminder for us to meet up for the party… Not one
                that
                deserves a written reply. I send him a thumbs-up in response. And sent a reply to Anastasia.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Anastasia, I had fun too. Do keep in touch.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After a minute of thought, I added.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): PS: You want to meet next weekend?</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The response came five minutes later when I was in the toilet.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anastasia (WeChat): Let us see. If I’m free I will let you know.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I send a thumbs-up and a smiley in response.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">That evening, I went to Allen’s house for the party and this brought me face to face
                with Alice
                Wang, who claimed to be embarrassed with her behaviour the other day and proceeded to apologise for
                whatever she
                said. She claimed to be drunk at the time and was going through a bad phase.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although I didn’t buy that story, I told her it was okay, but she was feeling very bad
                about
                her actions and wouldn’t stop apologising. After three rounds of apology, I proposed we have a drink
                together to
                show that there were no hard feelings.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">That one drink led to a second and finally, I ended up spending the whole evening
                drinking and
                talking with Alice. Even though she was a bit of a racist, she was smart and funny… In the beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After the third drink, she started rambling, in Chinese, about her past relationships
                including
                some Indian guy who dumped her like used up tea leaves when he was done with his China assignment. This
                sort of
                explained her anger towards Indians; this was personal rather than anything to do with racism. Also,
                despite her
                sweet, innocent looks, she had some experience with men. What I understood from her, was that she was on
                a quest
                for true, eternal love. A quest that started soon after she discovered the love of her life – a rich
                Shanghainese, mama’s boy – was cheating on her, with other men. He wanted to experience how being with
                other men
                felt like, but didn’t stop with one man.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">To put it short, she had a run of bad luck when it came to relationships. Any other
                time, I
                would have felt some semblance of sympathy, but at that point, I was only thinking of how to get her
                into bed –
                she anyway hated Indians, there is not much I can do to make it worse… Well… maybe a little bit worse.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I pretended to listen to her woes and even showed some amount of sympathy. I even told
                her
                about my annulled marriage and how my ex-wife had ripped my life apart. I made it sound worse than what
                it was
                and made it sound like it happened yesterday. She was listening to me in rapt attention and by the end
                of the
                story, I could see that she was moved by my story, as she was touching my hands to show her sympathy and
                proposed another drink. She got further drunk and by the end of the evening she was nicely toasted, not
                that I
                was not drunk, but as we all know its relative – she was way more inebriated than me. When the time came
                to
                leave the party, I offered to drop her home as she also lived in Pudong, about four kilometres from
                where I was
                living.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In the cab, we talked some more about our love failures and regrets, before falling
                silent. She
                sighed loudly and leaned against my shoulder. As I turned to look at her, I could see she was looking at
                me and
                there was something in her eyes which screamed, “Do it”. She slowly licked her lower lips and snuggled
                closer to
                me. There was a lump the size of a fist in my throat and I gulped it down silently. Her perfumes and her
                presence were driving me nuts. To say that I was sexually aroused would be putting it mildly, as my
                manhood was
                ready to rip a hole in my jeans.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I am not sure how but, after a couple of minutes or maybe a couple of seconds, we were
                kissing
                each other passionately. I slipped my hands under her blouse and caressed her lower back. She didn’t
                resist and
                I let my hands roam over her body until I have my hands were on her breasts which were well-shaped and
                firm. She
                didn’t resist that as well, so I let my hand drop gently until it dipped tentatively under the waist
                belt of her
                jeans. She abruptly broke the kiss and stared at me. I thought I had crossed some line as I couldn’t
                read the
                expression in her eyes. She gripped my hand and instead of removing it, pushed my hand deeper into her
                panties.
                When I touched her centre, she moaned loudly and pressed closer to me. We kissed deeply with tongues
                duelling
                each other for real estate. We didn’t care about the taxi driver; in Shanghai, he should be used to this
                behaviour by now.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">To me, it was apparent that I had a window of opportunity here to sleep with Alice. The
                only
                thought in my drunk brain was – <em>I want to fuck your brains out</em> – this thought was driven by my
                anger
                towards Jade’s rejection, plain and simple. But… I was in a dilemma – I didn’t want to do it only to
                have her
                complain later that I raped her after getting her drunk. As an Indian, whenever it comes to women, I
                live in
                perpetual and irrational fear of women claiming that I raped them after we slept together – I just
                didn’t want
                to get caught in the media stereotypes about Indians being rapists especially since I don’t know what
                they are
                writing about in China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All those cautious thoughts evaporated when Alice started mumbling, “Take me home,
                Anand… Take
                me home and fuck me, Anand”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I managed an “Okay”, in response before we continued with kissing and groping each
                other.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I didn’t clarify if it is my home or her home, because we were anyways going to her
                home and I
                was sure as hell not going to take her to my apartment. Who was I to resist a beautiful woman who wants
                to sleep
                with me? Plus, it’s not every day that I get an opportunity like this, given my average looks. You may
                call me
                selfish, but I know I am being realistic.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We soon reached her apartment complex and barely made it into her apartment. We
                stripped in the
                living room while kissing each other. I know I am objectifying a person here, but she had a nice, supple
                body,
                and I was thankful now that she had gone on her rant the other day so that this happened. I was so
                aroused that
                my boxers were strained to its limit. She saw this and nearly ripped off my underwear. She pushed me on
                to the
                couch and took me in her mouth. Even in my drunk state, it took all my willpower to not orgasm right
                there. The
                way she looked at me was not helping.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After about five minutes, she mumbled that we wanted me in her and tried to straddle me
                on the
                couch. Alice was so aroused that, she wanted to have sex without a condom. I sensible enough to fight
                her off
                for a few seconds to slip on a condom before she overpowered me and straddled me. She was aroused and
                uncontrollable. It was loud and crazy, with Alice screaming and moaning all the while. If I had some
                sense in
                me, I would have worried about the neighbours, but that moment my senses were all long gone.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She might have her personality issues but she was at the top of her form and very
                agile. We did
                it about three times before she started feeling tired. I was also exhausted by then. We lay together,
                panting
                and trying to catch her breath.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I excused myself to go to the bathroom and got out of the couch to go to the bathroom
                and
                picked up the used condoms which were strewn next to the couch. I trashed the used condoms in the
                bathroom trash
                and relieved my bladder. It was almost as satisfying as the orgasms.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When I returned to the living room, I could see that Alice had curled up on the couch
                and
                passed out. I stood there for a few minutes to ensure that she was indeed asleep. She was still naked
                and was
                shivering a bit, as the living room was chilly. I went into her bedroom, found a comforter and covered
                her up,
                as I couldn’t find the remote to her air conditioner. I didn’t want to be seen as caring and all that,
                but I
                couldn’t be seen as that selfish as well. She sighed and curled further into the comforter. She had a
                smile on
                her face.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I dressed up quietly and left the apartment. I didn’t want to be there when she woke
                up. In
                such scenarios, I knew my place – being not there when the girl wakes up for awkward exchanges that
                neither of
                us was looking forward to.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I stepped out of the apartment and on my way back home, I checked my phone out of habit
                to see
                if I had some message. There were no messages from Jade, two messages from Allen and some group
                messages, which
                I cleared out.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen Huang (WeChat): Dude, you left with Alice?! I was hoping to catch up with
                you.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The next message almost looked like an afterthought.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen Huang (WeChat): Dude, hope you are not planning to hook up with Alice. She
                can get a
                little crazy. I would suggest being a bit careful.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Too late for that now,</em> I thought, which was exactly my reply.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Dude, too late for that now. The deed is done.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Allen must have been up cleaning up the house or finishing off the rest of the alcohol
                because
                he responded immediately.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen Huang (WeChat): Oh, where did you do it? Your place, her place or Motel 168.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was walking back home and I had reached an intersection where the walk signal was
                red.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Her place.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The signal turned green and I crossed the road while avoiding a drunk electric scooter
                driver
                who was coming the other way.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen Huang (WeChat): Okay. Word of advice – if there is a next time, don’t take
                her to
                your house. Goodnight bro! Got to go now, Jean needs me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was looking at the map on my phone to figure out where to go next when that message
                came.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): No way she’s coming to my place, I barely know her. Goodnight
                bro.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">By then, I was sure what happened between me and Alice was a one-off thing. She would
                wake up,
                would remember what happened and would try to forget that the night ever happened. With that happy
                thought
                bouncing around in my head I light up a cigarette and increased the pace of my walk.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Turns out, the thing between me and Alice was not a one-night-stand thing. The
                chemistry we
                shared was so strong that we couldn’t stay away from each other. We met almost every other day at her
                place
                despite me telling her that I don’t want anything exclusive with her. I told her about Anastasia, in
                hopes of
                upsetting her, but she had only one demand that whenever I am with Anastasia, I should also use condoms.
                She
                said that she wanted nothing more than to spend time with me, which meant a lot of fantastic sex in her
                house
                followed by lunch or dinner and then… more sex. While I can genuinely say that I felt some amount of
                affection
                for Jade even at that point, with Alice I felt nothing but an animalistic lust that translated to
                fantastic sex.
                The way she performed the act every time was an indication that she liked the sex as much as I did. To
                paraphrase Forrest Gump, ‘the only way we didn’t do it, is apart’.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">At the same time, I met Anastasia once every week for dinner, drinks and a romp. We
                always used
                condoms and always kept it professional. We took turns in paying for dinner and motel, we never held
                each
                other’s hands or left together from the motel or we never texted each other socially. Anastasia would
                quietly
                disappear from my life four weeks after we met. She had moved on with her life (she met someone on
                Tinder or
                OkCupid or something and wanted to make an effort at having a real relationship) and we agreed to delete
                each
                other from WeChat, which by the way, we never did. I kept seeing her WeChat moments regularly which
                meant that
                she didn’t delete me on WeChat. She looked pretty happy with her new boyfriend and looks like they were
                pretty
                serious, travelling and doing stuff together.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Around the same time that Anastasia ‘Doe’ moved out of my life, stuff had started
                getting weird
                with Alice.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">She was getting upset with the fact that I had never shown her my apartment (I still
                went to
                her place to meet her). She was getting upset as I had not asked her for a date. She was getting upset
                that we
                were still using condoms (She was in an exclusive relationship with me, she claimed). She was getting
                upset that
                I was in an open relationship (I didn’t tell about Anastasia moving on). She was getting upset for me
                not
                cuddling after sex (She felt used). She was getting upset that I was living in a rented apartment when I
                could
                stay in one of her apartments for free (Her family owned many). She was getting upset with the fact that
                I am
                taking the metro everywhere I go when I can take her spare car which had a Shanghai licence plate (A
                Smart-for-two). In short, she was getting out of control. But, when you are thinking with your genitals,
                you
                just don’t know when to back off, until it is very late. That moment came around six weeks after our
                first
                encounter.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We were at her home, and she was on top, gyrating wildly and on the verge of orgasming.
                Her
                eyes were closed, and her back was arched as her orgasm built up in her. I was losing patience, so I
                thrust hard
                into her a couple of time and tipped her over the edge. She came, screaming “Oh my god! Anand… Honey, I
                love
                you!”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In retrospect, I wish I had left that instant, but that’s not how these things work.
                Her orgasm
                triggered a massive orgasm in me, which in turn excited her into another orgasm. She collapsed on top me
                and
                started kissing me all over my face, moaning, and whispering, over and over “Oh baby, I love you”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I said nothing as I felt nothing. I didn’t feel anger or panic or fear or sadness, but
                a
                certain numbness. I knew I had to end it. I don’t want to deal with permanent commitments at this point.
                The
                only question was, how can I end it and when should I end it? Also… Since I am soon going to be on a
                sex-free
                diet, I might as well get some more of it when the going is good. It would just be like having that one
                all you
                can eat meat buffet before you go on a strictly vegetarian diet. With that happy thought, I removed the
                condom
                and slipped on a new one as soon as I was ready.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the time I left that night, we were completely used up. I even cuddled her in
                between, which
                made her happier than all the sex we had till now. She went on proclaiming her love for me every time
                one of us
                orgasmed. At the end of it, she wanted me to stay with her through the night as she had assumed,
                incorrectly,
                all that sex and cuddling meant I was in love with her too. The reality was, I felt suffocated by her
                presence
                and I had to get out of there, but I was satisfied that I didn’t end it without getting something out of
                this. I
                made some excuse about meeting my MBA friends the next day for brunch, as I got ready to leave her
                apartment.
                She fake-pouted for five minutes and then drifted off to sleep. This time I didn’t bother to cover her
                with a
                quilt or anything. On the way back home, I turned off the notifications for her phone number, her WeChat
                and
                left her a short message as I reached my home or “rented apartment” as she put it some time back.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Anand Nair (WeChat): Alice, sorry I can’t do this anymore. I can’t be with you, I
                am not
                capable of love. You deserve better than me, I can’t give you what you want.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I wish I could say that I felt some guilt, instead, I felt nothing… Nothing at all… I
                slept
                like a baby that night.</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365575">
            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 25. Insanity Comes Calling</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The next day, I talked to Allen and explained the situation to him, as a sort of
                heads-up. He
                talked to Jean because, in less than twenty minutes, I got a few angry messages from her for me being an
                idiot
                and sleeping with Alice and after that, taking it so far.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alice has been crying and bawling non-stop as I was not answering her calls or was not
                responding to her messages on WeChat or iMessage. I have indeed been ignoring her calls (which was easy
                given
                that the notification for her calls was turned off) and I deleted her messages as soon as it arrived. I
                didn’t
                want to hear about how much she loves me and all that nonsense. She had been pressing Jean and Allen to
                disclose
                my address to her so that she could meet me and explain herself. Thankfully, they didn’t want to get
                involved in
                this anymore and told her that they don’t know where I lived.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Alice will be upset for a few days, maybe a few weeks and then probably get back to her
                normal
                self, and yes… she probably will never date another Indian in her life again. I wish I could say that I
                feel bad
                about it, but not really. She just got caught in the crossfire. For me, Alice was a closed chapter,
                despite
                whatever thoughts she might have had about our “relationship”.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The emotions that affected my mind and my actions were still seething in me. Despite
                the
                rebound sex, which I thought was the cure for heartbreak, all the anger, insecurity, fear and sadness
                were
                building up in me. I wanted closure, one way or another, but I couldn’t find it. I assumed that more sex
                was the
                way to go forward… A part of me recognised, what I was doing is not in line with my basic personality
                and thus
                was “wrong”. I knew that I was burning a lot of bridges, but I was not thinking straight at that point.
                Alice’s
                family might have been well connected and they can destroy my life in China, but as I said before, I
                didn’t care
                if I stayed in China or not. I was walking the fine line between sanity and insanity and what was
                appropriate
                and inappropriate for a foreigner in China.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One call would push me over the edge, triggering the final phase of my heartbreak…
                bottomless
                grief and insanity.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was around half-past two in the afternoon on a Monday morning, close to two months
                after
                Jade’s last message, when the call came. I was at work and was with my team discussing some of the
                roadblocks in
                our current project. I was already irritable as the week was off to a very bad start and there was no
                real
                indication that it was going to get any better. So, when the phone started ringing, I cursed out loud.
                Given the
                fact that the call came through, I knew that this had to be a repeat call since I had put my phone in
                ‘Do Not
                Disturb’ mode before I got into the discussion with my team. As I excused myself and stepped out of the
                discussion room, I glanced at the phone, and I saw it was an international call starting with a country
                code I
                didn’t recognise. Despite my ignorance, my heart and my mind started racing and my head was running
                through the
                possibilities. My irritability came down a notch as thoughts about Jade started racing through my head.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><em>Was it possible that the call came from Italy? Was Jade calling me to apologise for
                    what
                    she put me through? Or Was she calling to end it, once and for all, unambiguously, with no loose
                    ends at
                    all? Or, is it just some random advertising call?</em></p>
            <p class="paragraph">The questions were plenty, and answers were none until I answered the call to see who
                was on
                the other side. One part of me had started convinced myself that it was an advertising call, the other
                part was
                hopeful that it was Jade and she wanted to come back to me. I was more than willing to forget whatever
                that had
                happened, forgive her as long as she takes me back. I know, I am pathetic and shameless.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I slid the green button on my phone to the right and answered the call, “Hello?”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hello… Am I speaking to Anand?” the voice inquired politely. The voice on the other
                end was
                not that of Jade’s, but that of an elderly woman who spoke with a heavy Chinese accent. The very first
                thing I
                heard in the voice was an immense sadness that was suppressed. This somehow felt familiar, but just
                couldn’t
                place it. It was as if the person was holding back her tears. My instincts told me that I was not going
                to like
                what I was about to hear and my instincts told me that this call is about Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Hello? Are you there? Is this Anand? Anand Nair?” the voice repeated, snapping me back
                to
                reality.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Err… Yes, this is Anand Nair. May I know who is calling?” I inquired after clearing my
                throat.
                I might be heartbroken, and going insane, but I had no reason to be rude to an elderly woman.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Uhm… I am calling from Palermo in Italy. Umm… I am Jade Lin’s mother…” She got to this
                point
                and before I could say anything in response, started sobbing uncontrollably. I knew immediately, that
                something
                was wrong, that I have been wrong about Jade and I have been a terrible human being in general.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Over the next few minutes, Jade’s mother explained in between the sobs, that Jade was
                in a car
                accident about two months back (the day after they reached Italy) and she had suffered severe brain
                trauma and
                multiple internal lacerations, even though she was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident.
                According to
                the eyewitness reports, and dashboard camera recordings, Jade’s car had drifted on to the oncoming lane,
                had
                swerved at the last second to avoid an oncoming semi-truck and crashed into a roadside tree. She might
                have been
                suffering from the effects of jet lag and may have fallen asleep for a brief moment at the wheel, or may
                have
                been distracted by her phone, but the investigators were not sure. The car she was driving, her father’s
                old
                Alfa Romeo which lacked airbags, was completely smashed and the rescuers had to cut away a part of the
                car to
                get her out.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The head trauma and internal bleeding were so severe that, she had to undergo ten hours
                of
                surgery, and was kept on artificially induced coma post-surgery to avoid seizures. Despite the best
                efforts by
                the doctor there was no way she could be brought out of the coma, but she was kept on the ventilator as
                there
                was still some brain activity. About a week back she had woken up briefly, said the words “Anand… wait…”
                smiled
                at her mother, and slipped back into a coma.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Three days back, whatever brain activity monitors were registering, had ceased and Jade
                had
                slipped into a vegetative state. On the day before Jade’s mother’s call, the doctors and the family
                decided to
                pull her out of life support as there was nothing more that could be done. Since my name was the only
                thing that
                Jade mumbled out when she came to after the surgery, and since my number was in her favourites, her
                mother had
                called to let me know what had happened, and that… Jade was not with us anymore.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I am not sure at what point I started crying but by the time Jade’s mother had finished
                talking, I had tears flowing rolling down my cheeks. I ignored the concerned looks from my colleagues,
                as they
                walked by me; I am generally a cheerful guy and never had shown any negative emotions in the office,
                even when I
                thought Jade dumped me. I was cold, light-headed and dizzy. There was a constant whining in my ear and
                the light
                in the room was getting dimmer.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Needless to say, the guilt was also building up in me by the second. It felt like
                someone had
                placed a huge rock on my chest and the lump in my throat just refused to budge. I had assumed the worst
                about
                Jade and I was cheating on her while she was dying.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade’s mother was asking me something and when she repeated the question, I snapped out
                of my
                dazed state.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“How well did you know Jade?” she asked me again.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I tried to speak but no sound came out. I cleared my throat before trying to speak
                again. I was
                not sure what exactly to tell her, and after a few seconds, I decided to tell her what I felt was the
                best thing
                to say under the circumstances. The truth.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“Umm… We are… were seeing each other, madam… We loved each other and we were planning
                to get
                into a serious relationship”, I said finally when I found my voice. It was a lie, but at that moment
                that what I
                wanted from Jade.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The line went silent for a minute, and I could hear Jade’s mom’s wavering breaths
                coming down
                the line. I knew that she was about to burst into tears again. I walked into an unoccupied conference
                room to
                avoid any more stares. The moment I entered the conference room, she started wailing again and this time
                it
                sounded almost animalistic. It was the most heart-wrenching sound that I had heard in my life. I didn’t
                know
                what to do, or what to say, so I just kept quiet and waited. I will never know why she cried at this
                discovery,
                but selfishly, I hoped that it was not because her daughter was seeing an Indian. After about a couple
                minutes
                of crying uncontrollably, she mumbled something, of which I caught the word “Sorry”, after which she
                disconnected the call.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I sat in the conference room for a very long time, staring at the phone, and waiting
                for
                something, but I was not sure what it was; I guess I was waiting for that pain in the chest to subside
                or Jade’s
                mom to call back or me to stop crying. The pain in the chest wouldn’t subside for days, Jade’s mother
                would
                never call back and the tears wouldn’t stop for the next couple of hours. I wept silently in that tiny
                conference room until there were no tears left to shed. Finally, at around 5:00 in the evening, I sent a
                text
                message to my team members apologising for dropping the ball, quietly slipped out to the office through
                an
                escalator in the back of the floor, while avoiding the eyes of my colleagues who saw me crying and
                headed back
                to my home.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I spent that evening chain-smoking and drinking heavily while looking at photos Jade
                and I had
                taken together. There was a lot of regret, guilt and anger, for being a selfish, inconsiderate human
                being and,
                for deleting Jade’s WeChat messages. I wished that I could read every word she’s written again and
                again, but I
                was an emotionally immature idiot, who didn’t bother to think beyond my selfish obsession with her. I
                finally
                could cry out loud and that’s exactly what I did – I cried shamelessly and I wept for hours. A thought
                that
                didn’t help with my situation, one that had been nagging me since Jade’s mother called me, was that if
                my last
                text message to Jade that distracted her and led to the fatal accident. Logically, it was a possibility.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was a very overwhelming and painful thought, as it meant that I was directly
                responsible
                for the death of someone I may have been in love with… No! A person I WAS in love with and a person I
                still
                loved. The loss made the love real; until that moment it was all about anger, doubts, fears, options and
                selfishness, but when I lost Jade for good, that was when I knew what I felt for her was love. Now, it
                was not
                pure, unselfish love that one might read in books or see in movies, but it was real love, which was
                selfish,
                jealous and flawed just like in real life. True love, just like real life, is not perfect. At that
                moment, I
                realised I would have given anything for Jade to be still alive, even if she was not with me, and even
                if she
                found someone better than me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This gnawing thought, that I might be responsible for her death, meant that, I couldn’t
                sleep
                that night or the following night. Whenever I dozed off, I would have one of those nightmares of being
                in a car
                crash with Jade and the reason for the car crash would invariably be because I distracted her one way or
                another. I would usually wake up with my heart pounding in my chest, my torso covered in cold sweat and
                me on
                the floor. The worst part of this nightmare was not that I couldn’t sleep afterwards, but it was the
                fact there
                was this metallic sweet smell of blood in my head that refused to go away and I could hear Jade’s
                screams. I
                would spend the rest of the night praying to any God willing to hear my prayers to wake me up from this
                long and
                horrible nightmare like the way I woke up from the previous nightmare. While I was an agnostic, there
                are
                moments like, when I lost my brother and when I lost my Jade, where I wished God was real. But, I knew
                the
                truth, this was no nightmare, this was happening for real.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There was no God listening to me, if there was indeed a God.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I would sleep properly only after a week – a week that I spent barely keeping up with
                work,
                drinking large amounts of coffee by the day and larger amounts of alcohol by the night, neither eating
                anything
                nor sleeping well. I was trying to convince myself that I couldn’t be responsible for Jade’s death.
                Usually, by
                the time, I fell into a deep, fatigue and alcohol-induced sleep, the opposite had happened – I had
                convinced
                myself that I was responsible for Jade’s death, even though there were a dozen possible explanations for
                the
                accident.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Two weeks after the call from Jade’s mother, I threw myself into my work to try to keep
                my mind
                sane, and to drown the voice in my head that repeated day and night, that I killed my Jade. I ended up
                was
                working sixteen to seventeen hours a day. I slept less than five hours a day and developed dark circles
                that
                made me look like the demon. I had also started losing weight as I was not getting enough food – most of
                my
                calories coming from instant noodles or instant pasta, black coffee and alcohol. I had stopped shaving
                and
                cutting my hair and I was starting to look more and more like unkempt as the days passed. I was smoking
                close to
                two packets of cigarettes daily and my stamina was getting destroyed, really fast. I had stopped talking
                to most
                of my friends and my extended family, with official conversations kept to the barest minimum possible
                and at a
                professional level so that I don’t blurt out something absurd in a moment of grief.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">People in the office started noticing the abrupt change in me as I was generally a
                cheerful
                character who like talking and joking around with my colleagues and used to constantly invite colleagues
                for
                lunches, coffee or drinks. Some folks who were closer to me politely inquired what was wrong for which
                my
                response was “personal issues” with no further explanation. I declined their offers to go out for lunch
                or
                coffee and claimed to be busy. After a while, they stopped inquiring about my well-being and stopped
                inviting me
                out, which suited me just fine. To ensure that there were no more questions, what I did do was to use a
                lot of
                gel to get my wild hair under control, as I had stopped cutting my hair and shaving.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My only tenuous link to sanity were my parents, my sister, and Allen &amp; Jean. I made
                an
                effort to talk to them (my parents and my sister) or meet them (Allen and Jean). I managed to be affable
                with
                them, but it took a lot of mental effort to maintain the fa&ccedil;ade, but I felt it was essential to
                maintain
                the act to ensure that they were not too worried. I explained the weight loss and appearance as a result
                of my
                busy work schedule, which was sort of true, but refused to elaborate further what was happening in my
                life. I
                stopped responding to text messages from most of my other friends and even declined invitations from
                Nicole
                Zhang for coffee or lunch. I couldn’t get the thought out of my head that I was having a good time with
                Nicole
                when Jade was heading towards death. Eventually, Nicole stopped messaging, possibly had figured out that
                something was off and like for everyone else in my life, I dropped off her radar and she disappeared
                from my
                life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My sense of guilt was intense and I went deeper and deeper into a dark, suicidal
                depression,
                but had come to the decision that work, alcohol and cigarettes would help me manage my condition. The
                only thing
                that kept me from killing myself was the thought that my parents and my sister cannot stand another
                loss. I
                might be selfish, but not that selfish that I would put my parents, my sister or my dear friends through
                the
                same hell I was going through.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Given my excessive dependency on work, weekends and holidays turned out to be
                unbearable. Since
                a lot of my work depended on my team, there was no way I could work alone on the weekend. I had no
                reason to get
                out of my bed, and I spent hours laying and staring at the ceiling and wishing that time would pass
                faster. I
                would sometimes, bury my head in the pillow and scream hard until I had no voice left. On weekends, I
                often
                whipped myself using my leather belt, just so that I can divert the attention using pain.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had lost interest in outdoor activities. I used to previously enjoy biking or hiking,
                which
                was something that helped me when I felt troubled. The only thing that kept me from going completely
                insane and
                ensured that I pass time faster, was long meandering walks around the city trying to find some meaning
                for my
                existence. I avoided going to places like the bund where Jade and I had spent time together. Sometimes,
                a
                familiar sight would trigger some memory with Jade and that would reduce me to tears – I wanted to avoid
                emotional outbreaks in the public.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I wanted to leave Shanghai for good but was mentally incapable of looking for a new
                job. Nor
                was I in any sort of financial situation where I could take a long break – which meant I was stuck in
                Shanghai.
                I could leave the job and go back to India, but that would bring more scrutiny from my parents and
                relatives.
                That… I was in no position to handle.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">My walk around the city, usually ended up with me going to my usual watering hole,
                where I
                would ignore everything and everyone else but my drink. I would drink whiskey or vodka until the wee
                hours of
                the morning, hoping that it would ease the pain in me. I would stumble out of the bar at two or three in
                the
                morning and hail a ride back home. I would barely make it home before passing out on my couch or bed.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">A bit about this place I go any further… Here we had a sort of unwritten agreement that
                we let
                each other be. This is not a place you come to hang out with your friends nor was this a place where you
                come to
                meet new people. This is a place where we come to escape from whatever we were running from, have a
                couple of
                solitary drink or ten and enjoy some quiet time. And, as a foreigner, I even had the privilege of just
                pointing
                at what I wanted on the menu and get what I wanted without even uttering a single word.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This is the reason why I kept coming back here – The owners, the staff and patrons were
                very
                professional in the sense that we valued each other’s drunken space. I loved the anonymity this place
                gave me
                and loved the fact that no one gave a fuck. We were all silent drinkers and the most amount of
                communication
                that happened in our little world was when bartender nodded his head at the regular dipsomaniacs.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There was no better way to put this – I was hiding from the world, hiding from my
                friends and
                family, and hiding from myself. Meanwhile, I was trying to hurt myself as much as possible in the
                process. I
                drank like a fish, smoked like a train engine and got by with barely enough sleep or food. I was not
                getting
                enough exercise nor was I interested in doing anything outside my area of comfort. I didn’t want to
                shave or get
                a haircut, as those meant, I need to go to the supermarket or have unnecessary conversations. I stopped
                my
                Chinese lessons as that required some amount of motivation to stay in China, which I lacked at that
                point.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">People in the office tried to understand the reason behind my new-found obsession with
                work,
                but I guess after a point, the bosses were happy that I was doing two people’s work on one person’s
                wage. This,
                of course, pissed off some of the people in office who worked normal 8-hour days, as I created a huge
                backlog
                for some teams, and some people were forced to work overtime. Some people even complained to the HR that
                I was a
                disturbing influence to the others, but after a quick review with the managers, it was decided as long
                as I
                don’t listen to loud heavy metal or industrial music in the office while working, I can continue working
                the way
                I was working. The team were told that they continue working at a normal pace and prioritise only the
                high-priority item that I was sending down the pipe-line. The normal me would have been offended, but
                then the
                normal me would have been more normal and wouldn’t have pissed off my colleagues, even when I had
                disagreements
                with them. The HR wanted to help me, but I refused to accept any help, as I wanted to punish myself as
                much as
                humanly possible without killing myself.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Usually, I would travel to India a couple of times a year, once during the Chinese New
                Year and
                once during the National Holidays, which sort of helped to give me a culinary and cultural break. This
                year, I
                was not capable of facing my parents, friends or anyone else, so I made some excuse around the heavy
                workload to
                avoid going to India.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The heavy smoking &amp; drinking, lack of proper nutrition and lack of rest would all
                lead to
                aggravation of my mild asthma to full-blown pneumonia, which I didn’t get treated until I reached a
                point where
                I was coughing uncontrollably and spitting blood all the time.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I finally went to the hospital when I developed a fever so bad that, I could barely
                walk from
                my bed to my bathroom. Despite repeated requests and warnings by my doctor over my multiple visits, I
                refused to
                get admitted to the hospital for proper treatment or even reduce my smoking. I compensated for my
                smoking with
                strong antibiotics and asthma inhalers, which further weakened me. My doctor could see that I was
                depressed and
                advised me to talk to a psychiatrist. This advice predictably fell on deaf ears and I withdrew deeper
                into a
                dark corner within my sub-conscious, while my life continued on auto-pilot.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This downward spiral would continue unchecked for four months until that day at
                Starbucks. The
                day I would pass out due to hunger &amp; fatigue; the day Nicole would fail to recognise me; the day I
                had my
                moment of clarity.</p>

            <h3 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 26. Carpe Diem</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">At times, those seemingly life-changing events, aren't life-changing and seemingly
                insignificant events turn out to be life-changing. Whatever it may be, logic, reason and root cause
                behind these
                events cannot be understood (at that point) and as one matures, and as time passes, the answer might
                come to
                light. It will be like finding that long-missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The “Eureka!” moment…</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Meanwhile, the only thing that you can do is to be true to yourself and be ready to
                accept that
                your intuition might be wrong. Equally important is the fact that some of these questions may never be
                answered.
                That is okay, it just means one has to learn how to let go of things for which there are no answers.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This is the reality of life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">By the time I reached back home from the Starbucks on the bund, I accepted that I am
                possibly
                never going to know what happened on that day and how Jade got into that accident. There was no point in
                trying
                to beat myself over a past that I cannot change, no matter what. No amount of alcohol or cigarettes
                would change
                the fact that Jade is gone forever and, maybe it’s time for me to move on with my life. I needed a way
                to move
                forward, and I needed a way to cope with the pain.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">But before I go any further I needed to clean up my act. I started by throwing out all
                the
                alcohol at my home. After I had thrown out the last bottle of alcohol, I headed to my bathroom, and took
                a long
                hot shower, not because I was feeling dirty, but to soften my beard. After about ten minutes under the
                hot
                shower, I stepped out of the shower and towelled myself dry. I disconnected my electric shears which had
                been
                charging since I came back home. I set shears to zero and started trimming my moustache and beard over
                the
                washbasin. It took me nearly fifteen minutes to carefully trim down my facial hair to an even short
                stubble. I
                was startled by the reappearance of a once-familiar face, but much leaner and a lot paler than what it
                used to
                be six months back. I finished by trimming the sideburns.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I used a wet napkin to clean out the hair from the washbasin. I lathered up shaving
                foam on my
                face, put a new blade into my razor and carefully started shaving. Now that I looked a bit more human, I
                decided
                that I needed a haircut. I got dressed up and took a Mobike to a nearby salon run by a gay couple. I
                used to be
                their regular customer and they were happy to see me back. From my appearance, they guessed correctly
                that they
                didn’t lose me as a customer, but had stopped cutting my hair, for whatever reason. I got my usual
                haircut done
                and I looked almost normal.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I decided to walk back home and despite having to walk past at least five shops that
                sell
                cigarettes, I managed to reach back without falling off the wagon. I know it has been only a couple of
                hours or
                so since I quit smoking, but I was proud of myself, as the first few hours were crucial for me to
                survive on the
                wagon.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I spend the next couple of hours on Taobao buying, browsing for nicotine gums and vape
                machines. After I selected the product that seemed promising, I headed out to Century Park for a walk as
                my mind
                was starting to wander towards tobacco and alcohol. My brain was already starting to rationalise and
                pushing me
                to get that nicotine or alcohol high, and it was only half-past four in the evening. My brain was trying
                to
                convince me that it is okay to smoke a light cigarette or that I should celebrate quitting smoking by
                having a
                couple of beers or maybe a martini.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">While those thoughts were not eliminated, walking 15 kilometres around Century Park,
                certainly
                helped to quieten the noise in my head. It took me four hours, and I was exhausted, and breathless by
                the end.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I walked around the park, I tried to push thoughts of Jade out of my mind, only to
                realise
                that more I try to stop thinking about Jade, the more I thought about her. Just as the pain of losing my
                brother
                was always there with me, the pain of losing Jade will always be there with me. I had to find a way to
                manage
                that pain rather than let that pain control me for the rest of my life. I don’t mind it if the pain
                helps to
                shape my character, but I don’t want it to shape my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also knew that it’s time for me to bring back the people I care for back into my
                life,
                beginning with my family and my close friends. I would speak about this, voice my pain to people who
                love me,
                rather than let it seethe in my soul. There might be tears and emotions, but I needed to get this weight
                off my
                mind.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I was ravenous by the time I reached home and ordered a large dinner of fried chicken
                curry,
                omelette rice, a large salad, and pan-fried meat dumpling from a Japanese curry house using one of the
                many
                delivery apps. I was not sure if I could finish the whole thing but decide to order extra just in case.
                As I
                waited for the delivery to come, I took another long hot shower.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After my dinner had arrived, I started exploring some comedy movies on Youku (Chinese
                YouTube),
                as I badly needed to laugh, and finally ended up selecting some animated movie series about a fat panda
                learning
                Kung-Fu. I had seen the whole series before, but I was amused all the same and I surprisingly managed to
                complete my very large dinner, as I enjoyed the first part of the series.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I turned in early and slept deep. There were no more nightmares or dreams.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I woke up early the next day, feeling refreshed and resisted the urge to find a
                cigarette. I
                did some light callisthenics at home and went a walk around Century Park. I walked as quickly as I could
                and let
                the walk clear my mind. By the end of the walk, I was sure of what I needed to do right away – I needed
                to share
                my grief with people who cared for me – my parents & my sister, Allen Huang & Jean Li, and perhaps, even
                Nicole.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I took the shower to get ready to meet Nicole, I realised a few things. I have
                learnt the
                hard way that bottling up the emotions, denying what you feel and being dishonest to yourself are the
                worst
                thing that can happen to you. It’s even worse than losing someone you love – you lose yourself and your
                soul.
                The person you were will be destroyed and only an empty shell of the person you were will remain.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In retrospect… There are a lot of things that could have happened in retrospect, and in
                life
                there is no going back, only going forward, so I have to live in the moment. But one thing is clear, if
                you love
                someone, or care for a person, make sure that the person knows it because you never know what life has
                to offer
                in the next moment. Later it might to too late to appreciate what you have. If you wait for the perfect
                time,
                wait to get your words perfect and wait to be sure, you might just be too late.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I had made up my mind to get back to my life and continue living in Shanghai, instead
                of
                running away from Shanghai. The pain I felt now, will eventually fade. The grief I felt, will eventually
                wane.
                Experiences and memories shape us. I wanted my memory of Jade and the time I spent with her, however
                brief, to
                define me as the person I will become in the future.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I also decided to get some proper treatment for my pneumonia and spend a week at the
                hospital,
                which will help me keep away from alcohol and cigarettes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I walked to the metro, I texted my parents and told them that I loved them and that
                I missed
                them, and I promised to travel to India as soon as I can to meet them. Just as I reached the metro,
                messaged my
                boss and explained to her that I need a month’s vacation as soon as possible. Surprisingly, the response
                was
                positive, and she also added that I should take care of myself and the whole team is there to support
                me, which
                is more than what I deserved, given my recent behaviour.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When in the metro, I texted Allen and told him that I would like to meet up with him as
                soon as
                possible and talk to him about what has been happening in my life. He replied when I reached the
                Lujiazui
                station.</p>
            <p class="wechat-message">Allen Huang: Finally! Jean and I knew there was something wrong with you but
                didn’t want
                to press you. You are more welcome to come whenever you want. You can stay with us for a few days if it
                helps.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I replied immediately that I will visit them as soon as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I swiped out of the metro and walked to Blue Frog. I was feeling a bit apprehensive as
                the Blue
                Frog that I was going to was right next to the TGI Friday’s, where Jade and I had our dinner date. I
                steeled
                myself and walked faster towards the restaurant. I felt the phone go off in my hand and saw that Nicole
                had
                texted me. She had already reached Blue Frog and had got a table for us. She also gave me the table
                number. I
                thanked her and told her that I am about five minutes away.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As I entered Blue Frog, I saw the ever so beautiful Nicole Zhang sitting in the corner
                studying
                the menu. As if on cue, she looked up and saw me. She gave me her patented dazzling smile and waved at
                me. If my
                gaunt appearance shocked her, she didn’t show it. She stood up to greet me and gave me a warm hug. It
                felt good
                and I hugged her back fiercely. I was crying and I apologised profusely between the sobs for not keeping
                in
                touch with her and for being a bad friend.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">“It is fine, Anand, I understand”, she said continuing to hug me.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I knew that moment, everything was going to be okay and I was going to be okay.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Life is never easy, and there are going to be some dark moments in there, but when you
                have
                pillars like your family or friends like Allen or Jean or Nicole in your life, you will find the courage
                and
                strength you need to move forward and find the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
            <p class="the-end">THE END</p>

        <section id="_Toc51365577">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Epilogue</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Eighteen months had passed since that day at Starbucks and I was still on the wagon. I
                have not
                picked up a cigarette or drank alcohol since that day, and my friends and family had helped me get
                through that
                dark phase of my life.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There were many more days of disappointments, but Allen, Jean and Nicole, along with my
                family
                stuck with me and ensured that I don’t fall back into despair. It took months for the nightmares to stop
                haunting me, and I finally went to a psychologist to talk about stuff that was troubling me. This helped
                somewhat, but what helped me was guided Zen meditation, that helped me calm my mind and live in the
                moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole and I picked up right where we left off, and I started meeting her more for
                helping her
                company with growth strategies, until the day she mustered up the courage to ask me if I would like to
                become a
                full-time partner in the company to help her with operations and innovation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was about six months after the day at Starbucks and after the seed capital from
                the VC had
                come through. As I knew a lot about the business by then and I had somewhat helped to negotiate the deal
                with
                the VC firm, she wanted to offer the job to me, before she considered anyone else. The salary she
                offered me was
                just enough to survive if I moved into a smaller apartment, but she also offered me a 10% stake in the
                company
                as part of the deal, which she quickly upped to 15% as I sat there considering the offer. I accepted
                after
                considering the offer for the whole of sixty seconds, give or take a few seconds.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We are now preparing to raise Series A funding and the prospects of securing the
                funding from
                the same VC firm looked very promising. If this does work out, we plan to move to the headquarters to
                Xiamen and
                scale our operations out of Xiamen. I have volunteered myself to move to Xiamen and hoped to celebrate
                my next
                birthday in Xiamen. I was very positive that would happen. It was time to say goodbye to Shanghai.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Nicole told me that she would like to remain in Shanghai to ensure that she can deal
                with the
                investors, and because she had plans to adopt a couple of kids. She was not interested in getting into a
                relationship at that point but, she did want to raise kids. She was a bit disappointed that I wanted to
                move to
                Xiamen, but I promised her that whenever she needs me in Shanghai, I can fly down to assist her. That
                was a
                workable solution for her and me, as most of my close friends like Allen, Jean and Nicole would be in
                Shanghai.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The sweet memory of my Jade was an unbreakable bond to Shanghai and that in itself was
                a good
                reason to come back once in a while.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade remains in my heart, but now she inspires me to be a better version of myself. Her
                demise
                reminded me that I should live a little bit more and do what I want to do, rather than what others
                wanted me to
                do. I have accepted that I love Jade and will continue to do so for a very long time, perhaps until the
                day I
                die, but one day I will find the courage to move on.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Jade would have wanted that.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Gratitudes</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I wanted to take this opportunity to thank my friends who gave me feedback for this
                book while
                it was in its early stages.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Zhu Kai, who patiently went through every word in the first complete draft of my book
                and
                pointed out mistakes and grammatical errors. A Big Thank You to you!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Urvash (UV), Rohit, Anil, Dhruv, Shailesh and rest of the CEIBS Indian Alum who
                encouraged me
                not to drop the idea of finishing and polishing the book further. Thank you, guys!</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Feedback and encouragement from friends like Abijith, Cederic, Viji and family members
                like
                Prasad uncle and my sister, who bought the first raw and uncut version of the book with even more
                grammatical
                and timeline inaccuracies, also kept me going.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A special thanks to Prasad uncle who believed in me so much that he suggested a book
                tour in
                the US. I promise I will do that as soon as I find a publisher.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In conclusion to everyone who came back to me and told that they finished the book in
                one
                sitting because it was interesting enough, thank you.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">For those who asked for a follow-up book, I say this, I never intended this to be a
                series, so
                I thank you for the encouragement. As I said before to let the story be as it is, but for you here is a
                short
                final chapter I put together.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">And, No, in my mind Anand and Nicole will never get together as long as they lived (as
                some of
                you urged me to do) but will remain caring friends who were very much in love until the very end. Having
                said
                that, based on whatever feedback I got till now, I am seriously thinking of writing an offshoot short
                story.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">About The Author</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Vijay Menon is a forty-something aspiring writer who has been dabbling with writing for
                a few
                years now, over 25 years, give or take a few months. Finally, at the age of 35, he decided enough is
                enough,
                bought a MacBook Air like those real writers, and got down to business. He dug thought his inventory of
                half-written novels, and short stories from a few years back and found an unfinished short story, that
                he always
                wanted to complete. As he read through the story a few times, he realised that that unfinished short
                story can
                possibly become a book, if he can be a little bit more creative.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After nearly three years, countless rewrites (more than half this book has been
                rewritten at
                least twice), this book was born… All the while when working a full-time job. The first and second
                editions of
                this book was self-published on Amazon via Kindle Direct Publishing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">He’s currently living in Japan with his wife Gina in a small, yet beautiful city called
                Atsugi.
                During his time off from his regular job, he’s working on an offshoot short story for this book, which
                is still
                in the ideation stage. He also dabbles a bit in abstract art (All the art work in this book, including
                the ones
                that are not signed © Vijay Menon) and nature photography.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">He loves singing, and when he does that his wife strongly and lovingly encourages him
                to write
                more and create more abstract art as he is usually quiet during those periods of time. Anand gets his
                singing
                skills from real life Vijay.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">He still uses the same MacBook Air he bought in 2015, as this book didn’t bring in
                enough money
                so that he could afford an upgrade to a newer Mac.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Here are some ways to contact Vijay</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>Email – <a href="mailto:vijaysg@me.com">vijaysg@me.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">PS: Vijay has moved on and bought a new Macbook air in 2020 or 2021 and uses that for
                coding and other nerdy stuff. He is super happy with his life now that he has accepted that he found his
                true calling, to be a nerd and do nerdy things like learning new things and talking about those things
                to people (who really don't want to hear about nerdy stuff he has been doing).</p>
